Enough with the cliches.\\nMy point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to\\ntheir potential, they won't need much offensive support.\\nI realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust.\\nThere is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three other\\npitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first\\nor second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the\\nmound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most \\nruns wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage\\n(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low \\nscoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many \\nlow scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.\\nOn the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,\\nI would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.\\nThey would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their\\nopponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows that\\nyou do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard.\\nAll I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers\\nlike the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong.\\n   \n",

Already, there are rumors that Tampa may move to Milwaukee.\\n\",\n          \"After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that\\nMilwaukee should have an NHL team, I thought I'd pass along a story I heard\\nrecently.  This is second hand, so I don't know how true it is, but I have\\nno reason to doubt it either.\\n\\nBradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge\\nhockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can't remember his name)\\neither owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the\\nBradley Center.\\n\\nSupposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but \\nturned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too\\nhigh.\\n\\nLike I said, I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if\\nit's true, don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admirals\\naren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club\\nand a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBA's\\nMilwaukee Bucks play there as well.\",\n          \"\\nOf course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented.\\nJust as a penny saved is a penny earned.  Enough with the cliches.\\nMy point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to\\ntheir potential, they won't need much offensive support.\\nI realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust.\\nThere is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three other\\npitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first\\nor second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the\\nmound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most \\nruns wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage\\n(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low \\nscoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many \\nlow scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.\\nOn the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,\\nI would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.\\nThey would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their\\nopponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows that\\nyou do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard.\\nAll I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers\\nlike the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"rec.sport.baseball\",\n          \"rec.sport.hockey\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

drop\\nit on the groud. \\nIt doesn't have to have graphics, text only will do\\njust fine. It doesn't have to be fast either, 8086 will do, I hope.\\nBut you must stand a pretty hard enviroment without breaking apart,\\njumnping on it or trying to use it outdoor while it is raining and so\\nforth. I need 640Kb of memory and a convinient way of loading\\napplications into it that I wrote myself (floppy or somekind of\\nwriteable cartridge?). \\n\\nIs there a PC like that?? And where can I get more info?\\nI know of the Atari portfolio but it can't stand the rain....\\n   \n",

mine that I've decided to put forth the\\neffort to break, and I've done so; there have been other bad habits\\nthat I've decided are not worth the effort to break.  It's my choice,\\neither way.\\n\\nI am my own master.  I choose what I want to do.  I weigh the benefits\\nof my actions against their consequences, and I use my experience to\\nhelp me deal with the unexpected, which in turn make me more experienced.\\n\\nI don't always succeed, but I never fail, either -- I learn.\\n\\nDo *you* have any habits you can't break?  Why not?\\n\\n\\nI have arrived at my own understanding of Christianity, just as you've\\nprobably arrived at your own understanding of Islam that is most\\nlikely very different from the way a Moslem thinks of his religion.\\nAre you \"unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the\\nslightest concept of the Quran\"?  If that's different, then how is it\\ndifferent from what you accuse me of?  Can I accuse you of having no\\ndesire to understand even the slightest concept of atheism?\\n\\n\\nOf COURSE not.  That's disgusting.  For centuries, religions have been\\ndiscriminating on sex and treating women as second-class humans;\\nthat's one of the reasons I renounced my Christianity.\\n\\n\\nNo.  I don't insult people.  Period.  It's not in my nature, and it's\\nnot something that I want to do, either.\\n\\n\\nNot yet -- but my life is the ground I use to practice on.  The fun is\\nin the getting there!\\n\\n\\nWe don't start out perfect; we've got to strive to be something\\nbetter.  I know my shortcomings, and I know my strengths, and I live\\nmy life according to the decisions I make, and I am content to abide\\nwith the consequences of my decisions as easily as I'll accept the\\npraise for them.  There have been times in my life when I've made\\nmistakes, yes; I try to never make the same mistake twice.\\n\\n\\nI regard Christ as a myth.  I feel that there are far too many people\\noffering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and\\ndid.  The only person who can really judge me is *me*.  I choose the\\nroads I travel, and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of\\nany given road or turn back -- and as long as I don't *always* turn\\nback, there's no shame in it.  When I need help, I seek out my friends.\\n\\n\\nAnd you don't have a clue about what I'm saying, either.  Open your\\neyes and SEE; open your ears and LISTEN.  I'm not just spouting off\\nempty words.  This is my LIFE, this is what gives me MEANING.\\n\\n\\nHuh?  You're going WAY off the track here.\\n\\nI say my mother loves me.  How do I know, you ask?  I can point to\\ndefinite things she's done for me, and I can even just bring her to\\nyou so you can ask her, face-to-face.\\n\\nYou say your deity loves you.  How do you know, I ask?  You can't even\\nconvince me that it exists!\\n\\n\\nIf any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot, promising untold\\npleasures to me if I'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my\\nrationality for just this once, then I would choose 'hell'.  I can\\n*not* lie to myself to placate another being, no matter how powerful\\nit is.\\n\\nNote also that there are several gods trying to lure me this way:\\nYahweh, Allah, Zeus, Odin, Ra...  Please give me a solid reason to\\nchoose one of them over the others.\\n\\n[ description of Kendigism deleted -- hee hee! ]\\n\\n\\nThat paragraph demonstrates that you haven't listened to a single word\\nI've said.\\n\\nHave you ever gone to an amusement park?  Why?  I mean, after a few\\nhours, it closes, and nothing's different except that you're a few\\ndollars lighter.  Going to the amusement park doesn't do you any good\\nat all.  Why do you do such a meaningless thing?\\n\\nThe answer is that you think it's fun.  You play the skee-ball over\\nand over because you'd like to get better at it, even though you're\\nnot going to win anything better than a stuffed animal even if you\\nblow ten dollars on it.  You ride the roller coaster because it's an\\nthrilling experience, even though (because?) it scares the dickens out\\nof you.\\n\\nIn the same way, I think life is fun.  And I don't intend to leave the\\namusement park of life until they close down for the night!  :-D\\n\\n\\nSo you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, Santa\\nClaus delivers toys every xmas.  Don't you see?  I have NO REASON to\\nbelieve that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that I\\ncan't similarly apply to Santa Claus.\\n\\n\\nI can't do it, because your existence means nothing more to me than\\njust your communications over the net.  You have no more bearing on\\nnor importance in my life than that; remove it, and you will cease to\\nbe significant to me.\\n\\nAre you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a\\ncollection of verses in a book, and cannot be supported without\\ninvoking them?\\n\\nOr do you mean that the existence of your deity (and, in fact, any\\nother deity that can be written about) is as real as your own\\nexistence?\\n\\nWhy do you believe what you believe?\\n   \n",

This post will be LONG, I will\\ncomment on most of it, and am reluctantly leaving all of the original in place\\nto provide context.\\n\\nPlease note that an alt. group has been set up for the Clipper stuff.\\n\\n                                                     ^^^^^^^^^\\nHum, AT&T, VLSI and Mykotronx are 'industry'?\\nWonder what happened to IBM, this should be right up their street.\\nAnd a mandateed scheme is voluntary? Mr Orwell would love this.\\n\\n                                                 ^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nTelephone encryption and scrambleing are years behind digital ones like RSA,\\nIDEA, or even DES. The above, while literaly true, is a clasic straw-man claim\\nin the context of non-real-time circuits such as E-mail and the like.\\n\\n\\nI would modestly propose that a mandated use of ISDN would do more for commun-\\nications than this lot.\\n\\n\\nNormmaly DES.\\n\\n                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nNote the use of the word \"business\" in the above. The whole tenor of this\\nrelease seems to be establishing a ground rule that only \"business\" use\\nis legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's\\near to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate.\\nNote that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only\\nreference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized\\nrelease' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who\\nhave legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info.\\nThese people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the\\nkeys.\\n\\nThe criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens\\nto go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several\\nof them would be a better idea than CLipper!\\n\\nThem again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded\\nover the last decade ofr so.\\n\\n                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nNSA\\n\\n\\nYeah, this bit is VERY true.\\n\\n\\nNote the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption. A demo\\nof the above claim on an ordanary POTS would be a good nights entertainment\\nI suspect. Note also the 'many'. not 'all', as the general tone implies.\\n\\n                                ^^^^^^^^^\\n                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nThe case record seems to indicate that what is needed is a brutal tightening\\nof the current abuses. I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by\\nthe use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law\\nenforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies. And the phone vs other coms\\nis blurred yet again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLets run that line twice. Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated\\npurpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the\\nword \"ensure\". As to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', I will leave to you.\\nSo to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions,\\nthe answer in this press release is, YES.\\n\\n\\nJust as they only can wiretap now with a warrent. \\n\\n\\nJust makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved.\\n\\n\\nWhere do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-)\\nAnd as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It will\\nbe very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it.\\nAfter all, it is secure, isn't it. The govt will answer that point by its own\\nactions.\\n\\n                                                ^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAgain, personal use seems to be a unaskable question.\\n\\n                                                  ^^^^^\\n\\nAh, so warrents are not always needed it seems.\\n\\n\\nThe ITARs seem to slightly impeed this.\\n\\n\\nNote that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret. Only the 'proper people'\\nwill be able to express an opinion, hence only the desired result will emerge.\\n\\n\\nEncryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in\\nequilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers\\nhas resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no\\ndoubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practical\\npurposes by the middle of the next century.\\n\\n\\nIt is a little hard to critisise a non-proposal.\\n\\n\\nNote we drop back to 'phone-mode' again. If this is a true answer, it can be\\nrephrased as \" It sucks big time. Anyone who can drive the crypt work-bench\\nwill use it for light amusement before breakfast.\"\\n\\n\\nThis link between the security of the key-eschrow, and the actual algorithm is \\na real winner. Given that I have 2 secret 40 bit numbers, could someone please\\nexplain how the details of an encryption algorithm will reveal them?\\n\\n\\nJust make sure you read the CVs REAL carfully, OK.\\n\\n\\nQuick, with out looking back, What name is missing from that list?\\n\\n\\nThe people who agree with us and who think there is a buck in it for them.\\n\\n\\nThe reverse engineering provisions of the 'Mask-work' act could be relevent\\nhere.\\n\\n\\nYou don't. Not unless you are one of the 'right people'.\\n\\n\\nThey missed the word secret here. He needs a grammar lesson too.\\n\\n\\nI would say \"less secure, less conveniant, more expensive ( PGP is free ),\\nless available, and more prone to being comprimised\"\\nProofs to the contarary will be welcome. Note PROOF.\\n\\n\\nThey don't seem to be saying anything that makes much sense. And this proposal\\nDOES prohibit it except in a very limited way. And, this is the one explicit\\nreference to personal rights. It is a denial. And yes, I don't think that the\\nMexicans, Brazilians, and Canucks are included in Clinton et als magnanamous\\ngesture.\\n\\n\\nThe 'false tension' is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. The\\nRIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the \"false\\nassessment\". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps\\nYOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined\\nin the govenment language to be non-existant. If you don't agree, you must be a\\ncriminal, as only criminals don't agree with out laws. Also note the non-\\nquestion. \"If what is here was not possible...\"\\n\\n\\nIt indicates we know that Bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty < insert\\nsuitable retoric > and will stamp out this disorderly, unruley outbreak of\\nfreedom and ultra-national sentiment.\\n\\n\\nThis one is a real giggle. In Australia or France, they will have to reveal the\\nkeys, and the algorithm. Don't think it's at the top of my list of things I must\\nhave, so the restrictions will protect me from saleks trying to sell me a bill\\nof crock.\\n\\nAny for any others using it, they must be nuts!\\n\\nGood luck folks.   \n",

but some basic things\\nseem evident to me, things which this Clinton Clipper do not address.\\nThe all pertain to opportunites for abuse, and conclusions based on what\\nI have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons)\\nagree to.  If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it\\nalmost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse\\nIMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.\\n\\nI think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be\\nexpanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored\\ndata. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such\\nexpansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident).\\nThere was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please\\nbear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say\\nwhat others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.\\n\\n\\nAs I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or\\nsimilar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions\\nsuch as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how\\nthis thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat\\nthis in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other\\nareas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if\\nthis proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in\\nseveral other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not\\ngoing to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop\\nwhenever they want to.  'Court order required' has proven to be a rather\\nflimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the\\nmaterial, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on\\nperiodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice\\nsystem the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty\\n(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not\\nprotected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would\\nresult in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions\\non private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it\\ndoes make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially\\nfishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.  Don't give up the\\nright to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton\\nand Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,\\nfiguring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come\\nthose consulted could be roughly described as \"us insiders\"?  They cannot\\nquietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its\\nexclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.\\nDon't buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,\\npast or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest\\nand the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not 'unlikely'\\nor 'difficult'.\\n\\n\\nSo what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved\\nafter the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,\\neasily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,\\nwould authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  This\\nhas been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For\\nlocal cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds\\nhave a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe\\nfor example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen\\nin on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or\\nvia a 'master key'?  I sure don't.\\n\\nThis whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use\\nold-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping\\nwas rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law\\nEnforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes\\nthat require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I\\njust find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much\\nabout civil and individual rights, that \"puts people first\".  The question\\nis \"put people first\" to WHERE?\\n\\nWith the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN'T\\nexist a 'master key' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword\\nscan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific\\ncourt order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.\\nBet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that\\nthey have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to\\nkeep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? After\\nawhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks\\nthey deem 'disruptive'.  And if they get only one key, that would\\nreduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember\\nNixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn't it?\\n\\nAnd unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!\\nI see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice\\n:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to\\na competitor's Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded\\nto be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get\\none the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important\\nconcern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...\\n\\n\\nWhat will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You\\ncan BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.\\nIt is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the\\nargumet \"well, if you got nothing to hide...\"  Fine. Then using that\\nargument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in\\nevery room of one's home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but\\nthe principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a\\ngovt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as\\nto 'safeguards'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are\\npretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.\\n\\nDon't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish\\nbad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.\\n\\n\\nPeople would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years,\\nbecause we have this 'crisis' situation which MUST be addressed by some\\n'drastic action', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother\\nthose who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don't buy into it.\\n\\nIf the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public\\nso many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few\\nisolated 'respected experts' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a\\ncertain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected\\nexperts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was\\nadvocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the\\nexperts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper\\nChip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled\\nversion (with a 'master key' provision), or features not present in the\\nversion subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who\\nchooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there...\\n:-)\\n\\nAnd isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT\\nhave its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?\\nI was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything\\nyou have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this\\ngroup are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...\\n\\nAnother question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not\\nbe used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure\\nbut \"good enough\" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full\\ndescription (not a PR non-statement) of just what \"good enough\" means?\\nI think when saying how strong it is, \"good enough\" really means \"not\\nvery\".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not\\nacceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and\\nConstitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other\\ncountries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as\\nrevokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and\\nprotections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA\\nhave this thing to 'fight crime'.  We have allready have our Bill of\\nRights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining\\nfor yet another 'noble cause', instead we should be trying to repair\\nthe damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \"too\\nmany rights and safeguards\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court\\nsystem and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having\\n\"too many rights\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,\\netc).\\n\\nBTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe\\nthis:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed\\nthis thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights\\nunder the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades\\nhave been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the\\nConstitution.  It has to stop.  Now is as good a time as any, if it\\nisn't too late allready.\\n\\n\\n   \n",

I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past \\nyear. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because \\nI, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be \\ninvolved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they \\ntold me, \"Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for \\nthis kind of work.\" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at \\nthe Armenians, like \"The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way\\nthey've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live,\" and \"Things \\nwill be just fine if we get rid of them all.\" \"No problem, the Turks will \\nhelp,\" they say, \"if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an \\nhour.\" Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it \\nwould spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it. \\nHere we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one \\neven considered such an idea possible.\\n\\nBut I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative \\npeople I would often ask, \"Where is this all leading, do people really not see\\nwhat kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, \\nthere are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going\\non?\" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that \\neverything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of \\nit if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the\\ndemonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I \\nhadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were \\nunder guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. \\nThe women told me, \"There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade.\" I didn't \\nbelieve the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that \\nthey were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, \"Are you the First \\nSecretary of our City Party Committee?\" He answers me, \"Yes.\" And I ask him, \\n\"Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani \\nflag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know \\nexactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?\" And he tells\\nme, \"Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.\" Then I asked him\\nanother question: \"And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering \\nus? And he said, \"I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't \\nanticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.\"\\n\\nComrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the \\nAzerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: \"No, we actually didn't \\nanticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain \\nthe crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre.\" Those are his \\nexact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the\\nArmenian SSR.\\n\\nAnd now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them, \\nbecause it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors \\nconcerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't. \\nBut unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so \\nhorrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of\\nprogress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in\\nor around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really \\na genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.\\n\\nFor example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my \\nhusband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on \\nthe 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, \"You're in bed? You don't \\nknow anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they \\nwere overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars \\nand asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they \\nturned the car over and burned it.\" This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior\\nInvestigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was \\nreturning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my \\nneighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the \\nmiddle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they \\nwere stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him\\nhonk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and \\nI said, \"Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?\" And she said, \\n\"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely\\nsmashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw \\nthat they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \"Don't break \\nthe shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.\\n\" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was\\ntorn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians \\nalthough he's an Azerbaijani.\\n\\nWhile we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova\\nis the first to look out the window and say, \"Look, there's a crowd out \\nthere.\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had \\nalready started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian \\nfamily there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I \\ndon't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my \\nhusband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. \\nThere was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things \\nwere going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once \\nwasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished\\nthe Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \\nbeat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing \\nthe hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on \\ntelevision, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell \\nus why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't \\nhave touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the \\nArmenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.\\n\\nAt the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, \\nand so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly \\noff a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down \\nthere, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At \\nfirst I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, \\n\"Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there.\" And he answered, \"I \\ndon't know, could be.\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw \\nit, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, \\nhe didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging \\nher. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell \\ndown, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \\nbalconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \\nblocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two \\nfrom here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\\n\\nThen the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\\nof course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\\nI also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\\nthat woman, because I had just seen that.\\n\\nI asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \"You kill me first, and then \\nlet them do what they want with the corpse.\" But our neighbors, it's true, \\ndefended us, they said, \"There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away, \\nonly Muslims live here.\" Disaster missed us that time.\\n\\nBut at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, \\ncame back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's \\nupset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to \\nbalcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as \\nthough it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, \\nand I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look \\nand the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first \\ntime they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the \\nmorning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the \\nAzerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them \\ntoo. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking\\ngarbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went \\ntoward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \\ncould see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \\nAzerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \"What do you want?\" And \\nthey answered, \"We want the Armenian family that lives here\" [pointing toward \\nthe second floor with their hands]. She says, \"I already told you, we don't \\nhave any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman \\ntalking to you,\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around\\nher and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they \\nseemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing \\nand left. That was the second time death was at our door.\\n\\nI forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, \\nI don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we \\nreally didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth \\nfloor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight \\nmonths, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to \\nearn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture \\nand was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas,\\neverything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything \\nout the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on \\nthe left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that \\nhadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means \\nthat the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to \\nbe of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been \\nforeseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of \\napartments. Something on the order of \"We'll move the Armenians out and take \\nover their apartments.\"\\n\\nI have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I \\ncame as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the \\nConsulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I \\nknew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in \\nSumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was \\nbought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were \\nno ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw \\nall of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.\\n\\nI can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I\\nwent out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they \\nhad arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some \\nRussian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and\\njoined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with \\nthe situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on \\nthe buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure \\npeople would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for \\nthe Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But \\nhaving analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having \\nthought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. \\nIf a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, \\nand that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to \\ncalm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom\\nhe could whisper at the last minute, \"Go and announce it on television: \\nCitizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our \\nneighbors from this massacre?\" Those crowds weren't such that there was no \\ncontrolling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms, \\nmostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature \\nshafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we \\nnoticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were \\nbrought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was \\nsaying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend \\nus, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do \\nit. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, \\nwhat, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!\\nThe crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things \\nI didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They \\nwere in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them\\nfrom the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one \\no'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They\\nhadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. \\nWhen they returned to our building I told my husband, \"Lendrush, now the \\npolice are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably \\ngoing to find out and come to our aid.\" Well, alas, no, there were to be no \\nauthorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single \\nambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,\\nbeginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,\\nand burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, \\nit was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in \\nBlock 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they \\nattacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed\\nsoldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there\\nis that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and\\nI can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and \\nfrom the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, \\nwearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against \\nthat mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using \\nstones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have \\nguessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under \\nthe Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under \\nSoviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get \\ninvolved.\\n\\nIf you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the\\ntruth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five \\nyears that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered \\nme a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and\\nsome, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become\\noutraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a \\nSoviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,\\nor the property of some magnate, or some \"mafia\": If I want to, I'll get you \\nout of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do \\nsomething else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most \\nbrazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so\\nmuch. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had \\nthe nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid,\\nI heard with my own ears: \"Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something\\nthat you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so \\ninstead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything \\nwill go fine for you.\" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I \\ndo, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.\\nAnd the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see\\nit. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed \\nit, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got \\ninvolved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to \\nthe information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony \\nabout the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know \\nif they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer \\nbelieve in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all \\ndead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most \\nimportant, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that\\nall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in \\nyou--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...\\n\\nI want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such a\\nstate that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example.\\nOf course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a\\nson, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,\\nVitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or\\nrather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to\\nmake a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail:\\nWhen the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in \\nArmenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.\\nBut the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call \\nanywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off\\nfor no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they\\nliked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap \\ntheir hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.\\n\\nNow I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an\\nArmenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. \\nAccording to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the\\nsame apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put\\nthrough--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to\\nhis mother and said, \"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill\\nhim? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.\\n. . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart.\" His \\nmother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, \"Valery, you can't go because \\nI am afraid.\" He says, \"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, \\njust have a look.\" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's\\nparents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \\nsuperficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken \\neverywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian \\napartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that \\nthe windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows \\nin that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and \\nVitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \\nbeen murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks \\nago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \\nleft Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \\nYerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this \\nstraight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has\\nbeen killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and\\nhis classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit \\nthem, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in \\na coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \\nkicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought \\nthere in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .\\n\\nWhen we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, \\nthrow ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if \\nthese friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And\\nwhen you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When\\nyou saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.\\n\\nIf you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of \\nthings it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped \\nwere entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying, \\nthat girlfriend came up to one of them and said, \"What happened?\" and she \\nbared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . \\nthose rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that \\nI don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.\\n\\nNow . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,\\nwell, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,\\nsome six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group\\nof people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a\\npoint when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw\\nso much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .\\n\\nYes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians\\naround Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground\\nwith bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who \\ndon't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when \\nI arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are \\nnot only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they \\nwere guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a \\nsingle person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan \\nall the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack \\nanyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there\\ncould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't\\nknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \\nguilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\\nAzerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\\nonly perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \\nseems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \"Did \\nyou know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 \\npeople, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an \\nArmenian?\"\\n\\nOf course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and\\nnot become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to\\nthe time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.\\nWhen I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I \\ncouldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already\\nmentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \"Why \\ndid you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at \\nthese women who are strewn about on the floor?\" The overcrowding there was \\ntremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\\nalready sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \\ncooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \\nthe thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \\nit everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \\nwere never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized\\nto do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening\\nthat Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \\nwas given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \\npersonnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart \\nadvised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\\n\\nBut that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, \\ntried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\\nCommittee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\\nhand and said, \"Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.\\nI told him, \"No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of \\nwhat you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the \\ntraces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . \" Oh \\nyes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \\nvery funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, \\nexpensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \"Oh, why \\ndid you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\\nyou're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\\nto ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\\nalready getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\\nthem?\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who \\nhe was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head \\nand hid it. Then I said, \"My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We \\ndidn't come to you with the intention of stealing!\" \"Well kill me, kill me!\" \\nMuslimzade says to me, \"But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not\\nguilty.\" And I say, \"OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give \\nus an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \\nraping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \\ncarrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \\nthen?\" \"You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't \\nanticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\" I started \\nlaughing and said, \"It's truly funny.\" He says, \"What could I do? We didn't \\nknow what to do.\" And I say, \"I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell \\nyou: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in \\nfront with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \\nover his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was \\nduring the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\\neither he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \\naway, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \\nexcuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \\nyou tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \\nThat's right,\" I told him, \"the City party committee got confused, all the \\nparty committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \\nthey all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \\nimpunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two \\ndays, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \\nhave finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some \\nRussians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told \\nthem, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.\"\\n\\nAnd by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was\\nthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later\\narrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\\nthe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \\nasked him, \"What? How? What will come of us?\" He openly said, \"You know, for \\nus the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll\\nstay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\" The \\nGeneral Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \\ncities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \\nthe affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\\nas everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \\nhe gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \\nby the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, \\nbecause he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \\nand he said, \"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's\\nhorrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \\npunished, in accordance with our laws.\" And that's a quote. Then one mother \\nthrows herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\\n\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" They tried \\nto calm her down, and he said, \"In order for us to conduct a proper \\ninvestigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you \\nmust help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang \\nwho is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe \\nsomeone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that \\nyou're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having \\nlived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth \\nabout, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge \\nlater. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you \\ncan throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The \\nnames of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the\\ninformation. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is \\nnecessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening \\ngibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put \\nthe information into the urn.\"\\n\\nTwo soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, \\npeople who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she \\ncame up and said, \"You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as \\nwill happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you \\nplease write it down for me.\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like\\nher . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down\\neverything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if \\nit will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that \\ninformation. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply \\ncan't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, \\nshould someone say that black is white if it is really black?\\n\\n   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani\\nSSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council \\nof Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the \\none who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their \\nprevious dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, \\nand it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very \\npolitely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and \\nwhen I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, \"Where were\\nyou personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to \\nreturn, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where \\nit was all leading?\" he says, \"You're telling the truth. Let's not mince \\nwords. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell \\nyou the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole \\ngovernment was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about \\n45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its \\nfine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.\"\\nI say, \"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting \\nit?\" And he says, \"You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it \\nin Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . \" I say, \"Fine, \\nyou didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have \\nknown. Why did no one help us?\" And he says, \"Well, OK, we didn't know what to\\ndo\" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from \\nMuslimzade. Later, when he said, \"You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is \\nfavorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the \\nAzerbaijanis . . . \" To this l answered, \"You know what . . . I'm speaking \\nwith you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with \\nArmenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, \\nplease, Comrade Mamedov, \" I asked him, \"What would you say about this\\nhonestly, if you were being completely frank with us?\" Then he said, \"Yes, I \\nadmit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we \\nhave disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before \\nthe whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign \\nradio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.\"\\nAnd I say, \"There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it's\\npossible to add anything more awful.\" He says, \"Yes, I agree with you, I \\nunderstand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence.\" I repeat that he\\nsaid \"unfortunate occurrence.\" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what \\nhe was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--\\nand said, \"Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . \" I take this to mean that \\nhe really thinks it's an \"unfortunate occurrence.\" \"And of course,\" he says, \\n\"I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait, \\nbut it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being \\ntried.\" And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not, \\nthat 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody \\naffair.\\n\\nYes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in\\nBaku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an \\nAzerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, \"What, they didn't\\nnail your husband? They screwed up.\" I was floored, I hadn't imagined that\\nanyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up\\nto see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was\\ngoing to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from \\nFebruary 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \"I don't know, \\nTatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't \\nput it down as unexcused absence.\" I was really discouraged by this. They all \\nknow that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here \\nthey're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying \\nmyself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name\\nis Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a \\nParty member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and \\nsaid, \"Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \" He looked at me askance\\nand said, \"And why are you\"--he knows me by my previous last name--\"why did\\nyou get wrapped up in this mess?\" I say, \"What do you mean, why did I get \\nwrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,\" I tell him, \"I have an \\nArmenian last name.\" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as \\nthough he had eaten something sour, and said, \"I didn't expect that you would\\n. . . \" What did he mean by that? And \"how\" should he behave, the chief of the\\npool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a \\nreduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And \\nif someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what \\ncan you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!\\nHe's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, \\nthe Armenians are like that, and so on . . .\\n\\nBy the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked \\nhim \"Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return \\nto Sumgait?\" he answered, \"Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don't\\nwant to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I \\nwon't guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\" I say, \"So you've got another\\nthing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then \\nin another 50 years it'll happen again?!\" I couldn't contain myself any more,\\nand I also told him, \"And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew\\nabout it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in \\nSumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received\\ncomplaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did \\neveryone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the \\nway you treated them?\" And he says, \"You know, you're finally starting to \\ninsult me!\" He threw his pen on the desk. \"Maybe now you'll say I'm a \\nscoundrel too?\" I say, \"You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't \\nknow. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that \\ncomrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.\\n\"Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, \\nthat 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had \\ngotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. \\n\"We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of \\nthe Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of \\nArmenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in\\nSumgait.\" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, '\\n\"Well, I walked down the street.\" And I said, \"Walking down the street in any \\ncity, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation\\nbecause I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you \\nspend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't \\nknow you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd \\nhear something quite different.\" I told him, for example, that I drew my \\nconclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took\\nus all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;\\nthey got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the \\nneighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I \\nthought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some\\nanti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it\\nwas the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier \\naccompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything \\nthere were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with\\nus, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young \\npeople, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they \\nwere making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police\\ndetachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and \\ntanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when \\nthe situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they \\nwithdraw protection from the city altogether? There will be more outrages, of \\ncourse, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . .\\n\\n  April 20, 1988\\n  Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

This post will be LONG, I will\\ncomment on most of it, and am reluctantly leaving all of the original in place\\nto provide context.\\n\\nPlease note that an alt. group has been set up for the Clipper stuff.\\n\\n                                                     ^^^^^^^^^\\nHum, AT&amp;T, VLSI and Mykotronx are 'industry'?\\nWonder what happened to IBM, this should be right up their street.\\nAnd a mandateed scheme is voluntary?

The above, while literaly true, is a clasic straw-man claim\\nin the context of non-real-time circuits such as E-mail and the like.\\n\\n\\nI would modestly propose that a mandated use of ISDN would do more for commun-\\nications than this lot.\\n\\n\\nNormmaly DES.\\n\\n                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nNote the use of the word \"business\" in the above. The whole tenor of this\\nrelease seems to be establishing a ground rule that only \"business\" use\\nis legitimate for debate. If you want the nothings you drop in your wife's\\near to remain secret and private, that is not even on the agenda for debate.\\nNote that there is NO role for you to contain private info in this. The only\\nreference is to information already in the hands of others. The 'unauthorized\\nrelease' bit is also drawing a long bow. Most of these cases are by people who\\nhave legitimate access abusing it, and revealing, or often selling the info.\\nThese people are, of course, in this proposal, the people who will have the\\nkeys.\\n\\nThe criminals also use lawers, courts, the CIA, white-house officials and pens\\nto go about their business. When will they be outlawed as well? Yeah, several\\nof them would be a better idea than CLipper!\\n\\nThem again, the protections of law and the courts have been seriously erroded\\nover the last decade ofr so.\\n\\n                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nNSA\\n\\n\\nYeah, this bit is VERY true.\\n\\n\\nNote the repeated mixing of telephone scrabeling and encryption.

I have not heard, yet, of a case that was impeaded by\\nthe use of secure encryption by the men in black. The other side, abuse by law\\nenforcers is well documented, even by govt agencies.

Not **VERY** carefully what it says. The stated\\npurpose of the key eschrow is to make the use of Clipper compulsory. Note the\\nword \"ensure\". As to 'protect', or 'law-abiding', I will leave to you.\\nSo to the person who asked if it included the outlawing of other encryptions,\\nthe answer in this press release is, YES.\\n\\n\\nJust as they only can wiretap now with a warrent. \\n\\n\\nJust makes sure that the illegal ones are preserved.\\n\\n\\nWhere do you find many experts. Any ex KGB people looking for a contract? :-)\\nAnd as a later posting asks, what of the STU-IIIs they already have. It will\\nbe very interesting to see if the military and US embasies start to use it.\\nAfter all, it is secure, isn't it. The govt will answer that point by its own\\nactions.\\n\\n                                                ^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAgain, personal use seems to be a unaskable question.\\n\\n                                                  ^^^^^\\n\\nAh, so warrents are not always needed it seems.\\n\\n\\nThe ITARs seem to slightly impeed this.\\n\\n\\nNote that all this wonderfull stuff will be in secret. Only the 'proper people'\\nwill be able to express an opinion, hence only the desired result will emerge.\\n\\n\\nEncryption and codes have been around for millenia. They are generaly in\\nequilibrium with the technology of the time. The systematic study of cyphers\\nhas resulted in a swing in favor of the encrypter, AT THE MOMENT. I have no\\ndoubt that the factoring problem will fall in time. Probably fofr practical\\npurposes by the middle of the next century.\\n\\n\\nIt is a little hard to critisise a non-proposal.\\n\\n\\nNote we drop back to 'phone-mode' again. If this is a true answer, it can be\\nrephrased as \" It sucks big time. Anyone who can drive the crypt work-bench\\nwill use it for light amusement before breakfast.\"\\n\\n\\nThis link between the security of the key-eschrow, and the actual algorithm is \\na real winner.

Not unless you are one of the 'right people'.\\n\\n\\nThey missed the word secret here. He needs a grammar lesson too.\\n\\n\\nI would say \"less secure, less conveniant, more expensive ( PGP is free ),\\nless available, and more prone to being comprimised\"\\nProofs to the contarary will be welcome. Note PROOF.\\n\\n\\nThey don't seem to be saying anything that makes much sense. And this proposal\\nDOES prohibit it except in a very limited way. And, this is the one explicit\\nreference to personal rights. It is a denial. And yes, I don't think that the\\nMexicans, Brazilians, and Canucks are included in Clinton et als magnanamous\\ngesture.\\n\\n\\nThe 'false tension' is false. The balance is between two repugnant points. The\\nRIGHT to privacy is hand-waved to non-existance by putting it behind the \"false\\nassessment\". It is assumed that the removal of the right to take what ever steps\\nYOU deem suitable to protect YOUR privacy is non negotiable, hence is defined\\nin the govenment language to be non-existant. If you don't agree, you must be a\\ncriminal, as only criminals don't agree with out laws. Also note the non-\\nquestion. \"If what is here was not possible...\"\\n\\n\\nIt indicates we know that Bush dropped the ball in squashing that nasty &lt; insert\\nsuitable retoric &gt; and will stamp out this disorderly, unruley outbreak of\\nfreedom and ultra-national sentiment.\\n\\n\\nThis one is a real giggle. In Australia or France, they will have to reveal the\\nkeys, and the algorithm. Don't think it's at the top of my list of things I must\\nhave, so the restrictions will protect me from saleks trying to sell me a bill\\nof crock.\\n\\nAny for any others using it, they must be nuts!\\n\\nGood luck folks.</td>\n",

              "      <td>\\nI am not an expert in the cryptography science, but some basic things\\nseem evident to me, things which this Clinton Clipper do not address.\\nThe all pertain to opportunites for abuse, and conclusions based on what\\nI have seen the membership of this group (except for two notable persons)\\nagree to.  If anything bad is possible by the government in theory, it\\nalmost always ends up happening in fact.  So the key is to make abuse\\nIMPOSSIBLE.  Question authority, and remember power DOES corrupt.\\n\\nI think one has to regard this whole idea in the sense that it WILL be\\nexpanded to include other data forms, such as data transfer and stored\\ndata. and as such should be treated as if it were expanded (or such\\nexpansion will be almost impossible to stop, using Clipper as a precident).\\nThere was a hint of that in the proposal, remember.  That said, please\\nbear with me, I am not very articulate, so I take more words to say\\nwhat others could say much more briefly.  Thank you.\\n\\n\\nAs I suggested this is NOW.  The hint is in the proposal that this or\\nsimilar proposals are being considered for other forms of encryptions\\nsuch as data transfer, data files, and such, largely dependent on how\\nthis thing is accepted or flies.  I think one would be wise to treat\\nthis in the manner one would when (not if) it gets expanded to other\\nareas than cellular phones.  I think this is guaranteed to happen, if\\nthis proposal gets by.  Salami politics.  It has been and is used in\\nseveral other areas, it is certain to be used here.  Government is not\\ngoing to easily give up on the idea that they should be able to eavesedrop\\nwhenever they want to.  'Court order required' has proven to be a rather\\nflimsy guarantee.  If the case warrants, they can always sieze the\\nmaterial, and force one to give the key, or sit in jail forever on\\nperiodically renewed contempt charges.  So it is not denying the justice\\nsystem the information, nor the ability to lock someone up if guilty\\n(or refuses to divulge the means to access the info - this is not\\nprotected under the Fifth - one can be forced to perform ACTS that would\\nresult in divulging incriminating evidence).  So, blocking restrictions\\non private encryption is not preventing LEGITIMATE law enforcement - it\\ndoes make ILLEGITIMATE law enforcement a bunch more difficult.  Especially\\nfishing expeditions without the target's knowlege.  Don't give up the\\nright to be safe from that - that should be non-negotiable, and Clinton\\nand Co. know it (which is probably why they quietly developed this thing,\\nfiguring if they get it this far, they can ram it on through).  How come\\nthose consulted could be roughly described as \"us insiders\"?  They cannot\\nquietely IMPLIMENT it though, when they ban other schemes to ensure its\\nexclusive use.  Hence the nice PR document to try and reassure everyone.\\nDon't buy into it.  Has government really earned that kind of trust,\\npast or future?  To be secure and free, one must keep government honest\\nand the only way to do that is to make abuse IMPOSSIBLE, not 'unlikely'\\nor 'difficult'.\\n\\n\\nSo what?  One could use information gained by re-use of the keys (saved\\nafter the last case was finished) or other means (master key, backdoor,\\neasily broken algorithm) to find other evidence which, given to a judge,\\nwould authorize a tap which wouldn't have been possible otherwise.  This\\nhas been the more common manner of abuse of wiretaps in the past...  For\\nlocal cops, this might be workable to keep them honest, but the Feds\\nhave a workaround somehow, BET on it.  Does anyone really believe\\nfor example, that the government will use a scheme NSA cannot listen\\nin on scanning for keywords - either easily defeated in realtime or\\nvia a 'master key'?  I sure don't.\\n\\nThis whole thing sounds like something to eliminate the need to use\\nold-fashioned police work to build a case.  In the past, eavesdropping\\nwas rather easy (with or without a court order).  I think the Law\\nEnforcement community has become a bit spoiled, and will resist changes\\nthat require them to revert to using old-fashioned detective work.  I\\njust find it somewhat surprising coming from a bunch that cares so much\\nabout civil and individual rights, that \"puts people first\".  The question\\nis \"put people first\" to WHERE?\\n\\nWith the innards not being revealed, how is one to be sure there DOESN'T\\nexist a 'master key' for use by NSA, etc (so they can do their keyword\\nscan, etc on conversations they routinely monitor, without a specific\\ncourt order)?   Remember, the cellular phone limitiation is only TEMPORARY.\\nBet on it.  And so far I have not heard about police telling people that\\nthey have been tapped and nothing incriminating was found.  What is to\\nkeep them from simply keeping the keys on file for 'next time'? After\\nawhile, they would have quite a collection.  Kept especially for folks\\nthey deem 'disruptive'.  And if they get only one key, that would\\nreduce the search space a lot, unless it is an RSA scheme.  Remember\\nNixon years?  Need for court orders really slowed them down, didn't it?\\n\\nAnd unless the escrow accounts are not government controlled (fat chance!\\nI see one ending up being under, say Treasury, the other under Justice\\n:-)) it could be worth some serious bucks to some folks to get keys to\\na competitor's Clinton Clipper (or descendent when this idea is expanded\\nto be used for all non-government encryption).  Enough bucks would get\\none the keys or the innards for this algorithm.  Perhaps not an important\\nconcern, but given past government behavior and the other problems...\\n\\n\\nWhat will one do when it is expanded to data storage encryption?  You\\ncan BET that if Clipper is accepted, that will be next on the agenda.\\nIt is even hinted at in the proposal - read it carefully...  Expect the\\nargumet \"well, if you got nothing to hide...\"  Fine. Then using that\\nargument, one should not object to video cameras being installed in\\nevery room of one's home.  Granted - an exteme expansion of the idea but\\nthe principle holds.  Private stuff should remain private, even from a\\ngovt fishing expedition.  And laws/rules may change in the future as\\nto 'safeguards'.  When it comes to the Fed Government, safeguards are\\npretty meaningless, if they want to do/get something.\\n\\nDon't work so hard to give up some rather treasured rights, or establish\\nbad precidents, please.  The price could be hell to pay, later.\\n\\n\\nPeople would fight laws forbidding more NOW, but in, say two years,\\nbecause we have this 'crisis' situation which MUST be addressed by some\\n'drastic action', just this added reasonable restriction will only bother\\nthose who have someting to hide... etc.  Please don't buy into it.\\n\\nIf the Clinton Clipper is so very good, why not make its algrithm public\\nso many people can exchange ideas and examine it, rather than a few\\nisolated 'respected experts' (respected by whom?  for what?  Perhaps a\\ncertain professor who likes key banks would be one of the selected\\nexperts... this does seem to expand on some ideas the person was\\nadvocating, if I recall :-).  How would anybody know that what the\\nexperts examine is the same as what will end up being used in the Clipper\\nChip, if it is kept secret?   Perhaps the Clipper will use a crippled\\nversion (with a 'master key' provision), or features not present in the\\nversion subjected for study and evaluation by the experts.  And who\\nchooses the expertes?  The government?  No conflict of interest there...\\n:-)\\n\\nAnd isn't it a REQUIREMENT for any decent encryption scheme that it NOT\\nhave its effectiveness reduced by having the algrorithm widely known?\\nI was lead to believe that one should assume the other side has everything\\nyou have, except for the key(s)... I recall ideas presented to this\\ngroup are rejected if a requirement exists the algorithm be secret...\\n\\nAnother question - since it is a safe bet this Clipper thing would not\\nbe used for government security, they are regarding it as not real secure\\nbut \"good enough\" for common folk.  I think I would like to see a full\\ndescription (not a PR non-statement) of just what \"good enough\" means?\\nI think when saying how strong it is, \"good enough\" really means \"not\\nvery\".  The excuse that other countries have these restrictions is not\\nacceptable:  Other countries do not have our Bill of Rights and\\nConstitution (which the people, not the governments, of those other\\ncountries often regard with envy - what we have as rights they have as\\nrevokable privileges).  And if we expect to retain those rights and\\nprotections, we must not allow them to be gutted because we just GOTTA\\nhave this thing to 'fight crime'.  We have allready have our Bill of\\nRights pretty much torn to shreds.  We should not permit more weakining\\nfor yet another 'noble cause', instead we should be trying to repair\\nthe damage.  Our crime problem may have a number of causes, but \"too\\nmany rights and safeguards\" is not a signifigant one.  A broken court\\nsystem and poor police work are a much more signifigant cause as having\\n\"too many rights\" (disregarding addressing the root causes for crime,\\netc).\\n\\nBTW - those who suggest that this is just an attack on Clinton, believe\\nthis:  I would be going ballistic reagardless WHO seriously proposed\\nthis thing.  It is just another step in a gradual erosion of our rights\\nunder the Constitution or Bill of Rights.  The last couple of decades\\nhave been a non-stop series of end-runs around the protections of the\\nConstitution.  It has to stop.  Now is as good a time as any, if it\\nisn't too late allready.\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

I moved there from\\nNovosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred\\nto Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is\\nArutunian, my husband's name . . .\\n\\nThat there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints \\nand gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the \\nRussians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past \\nyear. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because \\nI, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be \\ninvolved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they \\ntold me, \"Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for \\nthis kind of work.\" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at \\nthe Armenians, like \"The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way\\nthey've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live,\" and \"Things \\nwill be just fine if we get rid of them all.\" \"No problem, the Turks will \\nhelp,\" they say, \"if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an \\nhour.\" Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it \\nwould spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it. \\nHere we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one \\neven considered such an idea possible.\\n\\nBut I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative \\npeople I would often ask, \"Where is this all leading, do people really not see\\nwhat kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, \\nthere are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going\\non?\" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that \\neverything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of \\nit if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the\\ndemonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I \\nhadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were \\nunder guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. \\nThe women told me, \"There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade.\" I didn't \\nbelieve the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that \\nthey were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, \"Are you the First \\nSecretary of our City Party Committee?\" He answers me, \"Yes.\" And I ask him, \\n\"Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani \\nflag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know \\nexactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?\" And he tells\\nme, \"Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.\" Then I asked him\\nanother question: \"And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering \\nus? And he said, \"I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't \\nanticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.\"\\n\\nComrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the \\nAzerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: \"No, we actually didn't \\nanticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain \\nthe crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre.\" Those are his \\nexact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the\\nArmenian SSR.\\n\\nAnd now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them, \\nbecause it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors \\nconcerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't. \\nBut unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so \\nhorrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of\\nprogress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in\\nor around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really \\na genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.\\n\\nFor example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my \\nhusband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on \\nthe 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, \"You're in bed? You don't \\nknow anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they \\nwere overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars \\nand asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they \\nturned the car over and burned it.\" This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior\\nInvestigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was \\nreturning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my \\nneighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the \\nmiddle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they \\nwere stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him\\nhonk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and \\nI said, \"Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?\" And she said, \\n\"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely\\nsmashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw \\nthat they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \"Don't break \\nthe shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.\\n\" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was\\ntorn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians \\nalthough he's an Azerbaijani.\\n\\nWhile we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova\\nis the first to look out the window and say, \"Look, there's a crowd out \\nthere.\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had \\nalready started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian \\nfamily there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I \\ndon't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my \\nhusband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. \\nThere was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things \\nwere going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once \\nwasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished\\nthe Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \\nbeat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing \\nthe hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on \\ntelevision, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell \\nus why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't \\nhave touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the \\nArmenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.\\n\\nAt the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, \\nand so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly \\noff a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down \\nthere, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At \\nfirst I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, \\n\"Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there.\" And he answered, \"I \\ndon't know, could be.\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw \\nit, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, \\nhe didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging \\nher. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell \\ndown, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \\nbalconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \\nblocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two \\nfrom here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\\n\\nThen the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\\nof course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\\nI also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\\nthat woman, because I had just seen that.\\n\\nI asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \"You kill me first, and then \\nlet them do what they want with the corpse.\" But our neighbors, it's true, \\ndefended us, they said, \"There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away, \\nonly Muslims live here.\" Disaster missed us that time.\\n\\nBut at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, \\ncame back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's \\nupset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to \\nbalcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as \\nthough it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, \\nand I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look \\nand the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first \\ntime they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the \\nmorning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the \\nAzerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them \\ntoo. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking\\ngarbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went \\ntoward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \\ncould see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \\nAzerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \"What do you want?\" And \\nthey answered, \"We want the Armenian family that lives here\" [pointing toward \\nthe second floor with their hands]. She says, \"I already told you, we don't \\nhave any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman \\ntalking to you,\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around\\nher and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they \\nseemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing \\nand left. That was the second time death was at our door.\\n\\nI forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, \\nI don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we \\nreally didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth \\nfloor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight \\nmonths, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to \\nearn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture \\nand was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas,\\neverything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything \\nout the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on \\nthe left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that \\nhadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means \\nthat the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to \\nbe of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been \\nforeseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of \\napartments. Something on the order of \"We'll move the Armenians out and take \\nover their apartments.\"\\n\\nI have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I \\ncame as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the \\nConsulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I \\nknew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in \\nSumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was \\nbought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were \\nno ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw \\nall of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.\\n\\nI can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I\\nwent out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they \\nhad arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some \\nRussian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and\\njoined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with \\nthe situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on \\nthe buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure \\npeople would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for \\nthe Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But \\nhaving analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having \\nthought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. \\nIf a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, \\nand that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to \\ncalm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom\\nhe could whisper at the last minute, \"Go and announce it on television: \\nCitizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our \\nneighbors from this massacre?\" Those crowds weren't such that there was no \\ncontrolling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms, \\nmostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature \\nshafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we \\nnoticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were \\nbrought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was \\nsaying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend \\nus, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do \\nit. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, \\nwhat, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!\\nThe crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things \\nI didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They \\nwere in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them\\nfrom the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one \\no'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They\\nhadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. \\nWhen they returned to our building I told my husband, \"Lendrush, now the \\npolice are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably \\ngoing to find out and come to our aid.\" Well, alas, no, there were to be no \\nauthorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single \\nambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,\\nbeginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,\\nand burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, \\nit was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in \\nBlock 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they \\nattacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed\\nsoldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there\\nis that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and\\nI can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and \\nfrom the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, \\nwearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against \\nthat mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using \\nstones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have \\nguessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under \\nthe Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under \\nSoviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get \\ninvolved.\\n\\nIf you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the\\ntruth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five \\nyears that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered \\nme a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and\\nsome, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become\\noutraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a \\nSoviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,\\nor the property of some magnate, or some \"mafia\": If I want to, I'll get you \\nout of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do \\nsomething else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most \\nbrazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so\\nmuch. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had \\nthe nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid,\\nI heard with my own ears: \"Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something\\nthat you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so \\ninstead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything \\nwill go fine for you.\" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I \\ndo, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.\\nAnd the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see\\nit. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed \\nit, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got \\ninvolved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to \\nthe information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony \\nabout the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know \\nif they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer \\nbelieve in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all \\ndead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most \\nimportant, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that\\nall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in \\nyou--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...\\n\\nI want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such a\\nstate that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example.\\nOf course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a\\nson, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,\\nVitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or\\nrather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to\\nmake a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail:\\nWhen the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in \\nArmenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.\\nBut the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call \\nanywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off\\nfor no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they\\nliked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap \\ntheir hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.\\n\\nNow I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an\\nArmenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. \\nAccording to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the\\nsame apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put\\nthrough--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to\\nhis mother and said, \"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill\\nhim? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.\\n. . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart.\" His \\nmother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, \"Valery, you can't go because \\nI am afraid.\" He says, \"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, \\njust have a look.\" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's\\nparents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \\nsuperficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken \\neverywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian \\napartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that \\nthe windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows \\nin that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and \\nVitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \\nbeen murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks \\nago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \\nleft Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \\nYerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this \\nstraight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has\\nbeen killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and\\nhis classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit \\nthem, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in \\na coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \\nkicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought \\nthere in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .\\n\\nWhen we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, \\nthrow ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if \\nthese friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And\\nwhen you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When\\nyou saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.\\n\\nIf you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of \\nthings it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped \\nwere entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying, \\nthat girlfriend came up to one of them and said, \"What happened?\" and she \\nbared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . \\nthose rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that \\nI don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.\\n\\nNow . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,\\nwell, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,\\nsome six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group\\nof people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a\\npoint when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw\\nso much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .\\n\\nYes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians\\naround Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground\\nwith bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who \\ndon't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when \\nI arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are \\nnot only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they \\nwere guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a \\nsingle person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan \\nall the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack \\nanyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there\\ncould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't\\nknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \\nguilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\\nAzerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\\nonly perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \\nseems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \"Did \\nyou know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 \\npeople, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an \\nArmenian?\"\\n\\nOf course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and\\nnot become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to\\nthe time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.\\nWhen I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I \\ncouldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already\\nmentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \"Why \\ndid you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at \\nthese women who are strewn about on the floor?\" The overcrowding there was \\ntremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\\nalready sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \\ncooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \\nthe thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \\nit everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \\nwere never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized\\nto do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening\\nthat Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \\nwas given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \\npersonnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart \\nadvised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\\n\\nBut that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, \\ntried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\\nCommittee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\\nhand and said, \"Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.\\nI told him, \"No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of \\nwhat you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the \\ntraces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . \" Oh \\nyes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \\nvery funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, \\nexpensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \"Oh, why \\ndid you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\\nyou're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\\nto ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\\nalready getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\\nthem?\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who \\nhe was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head \\nand hid it. Then I said, \"My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We \\ndidn't come to you with the intention of stealing!\" \"Well kill me, kill me!\" \\nMuslimzade says to me, \"But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not\\nguilty.\" And I say, \"OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give \\nus an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \\nraping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \\ncarrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \\nthen?\" \"You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't \\nanticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\" I started \\nlaughing and said, \"It's truly funny.\" He says, \"What could I do? We didn't \\nknow what to do.\" And I say, \"I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell \\nyou: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in \\nfront with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \\nover his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was \\nduring the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\\neither he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \\naway, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \\nexcuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \\nyou tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \\nThat's right,\" I told him, \"the City party committee got confused, all the \\nparty committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \\nthey all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \\nimpunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two \\ndays, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \\nhave finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some \\nRussians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told \\nthem, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.\"\\n\\nAnd by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was\\nthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later\\narrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\\nthe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \\nasked him, \"What? How? What will come of us?\" He openly said, \"You know, for \\nus the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll\\nstay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\" The \\nGeneral Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \\ncities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \\nthe affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\\nas everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \\nhe gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \\nby the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, \\nbecause he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \\nand he said, \"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's\\nhorrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \\npunished, in accordance with our laws.\" And that's a quote. Then one mother \\nthrows herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\\n\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\" They tried \\nto calm her down, and he said, \"In order for us to conduct a proper \\ninvestigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you \\nmust help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang \\nwho is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe \\nsomeone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that \\nyou're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having \\nlived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth \\nabout, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge \\nlater. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you \\ncan throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The \\nnames of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the\\ninformation. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is \\nnecessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening \\ngibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put \\nthe information into the urn.\"\\n\\nTwo soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, \\npeople who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she \\ncame up and said, \"You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as \\nwill happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you \\nplease write it down for me.\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like\\nher . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down\\neverything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if \\nit will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that \\ninformation. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply \\ncan't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, \\nshould someone say that black is white if it is really black?\\n\\n   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani\\nSSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council \\nof Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the \\none who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their \\nprevious dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, \\nand it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very \\npolitely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and \\nwhen I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, \"Where were\\nyou personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to \\nreturn, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where \\nit was all leading?\" he says, \"You're telling the truth. Let's not mince \\nwords. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell \\nyou the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole \\ngovernment was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about \\n45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its \\nfine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.\"\\nI say, \"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting \\nit?\" And he says, \"You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it \\nin Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . \" I say, \"Fine, \\nyou didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have \\nknown. Why did no one help us?\" And he says, \"Well, OK, we didn't know what to\\ndo\" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from \\nMuslimzade. Later, when he said, \"You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is \\nfavorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the \\nAzerbaijanis . . . \" To this l answered, \"You know what . . . I'm speaking \\nwith you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with \\nArmenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, \\nplease, Comrade Mamedov, \" I asked him, \"What would you say about this\\nhonestly, if you were being completely frank with us?\" Then he said, \"Yes, I \\nadmit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we \\nhave disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before \\nthe whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign \\nradio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.\"\\nAnd I say, \"There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it's\\npossible to add anything more awful.\" He says, \"Yes, I agree with you, I \\nunderstand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence.\" I repeat that he\\nsaid \"unfortunate occurrence.\" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what \\nhe was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--\\nand said, \"Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . \" I take this to mean that \\nhe really thinks it's an \"unfortunate occurrence.\" \"And of course,\" he says, \\n\"I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait, \\nbut it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being \\ntried.\" And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not, \\nthat 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody \\naffair.\\n\\nYes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in\\nBaku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an \\nAzerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, \"What, they didn't\\nnail your husband? They screwed up.\" I was floored, I hadn't imagined that\\nanyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up\\nto see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was\\ngoing to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from \\nFebruary 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \"I don't know, \\nTatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't \\nput it down as unexcused absence.\" I was really discouraged by this. They all \\nknow that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here \\nthey're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying \\nmyself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name\\nis Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a \\nParty member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and \\nsaid, \"Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \" He looked at me askance\\nand said, \"And why are you\"--he knows me by my previous last name--\"why did\\nyou get wrapped up in this mess?\" I say, \"What do you mean, why did I get \\nwrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,\" I tell him, \"I have an \\nArmenian last name.\" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as \\nthough he had eaten something sour, and said, \"I didn't expect that you would\\n. . . \" What did he mean by that? And \"how\" should he behave, the chief of the\\npool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a \\nreduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And \\nif someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what \\ncan you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!\\nHe's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, \\nthe Armenians are like that, and so on . . .\\n\\nBy the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked \\nhim \"Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return \\nto Sumgait?\" he answered, \"Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don't\\nwant to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I \\nwon't guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\" I say, \"So you've got another\\nthing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then \\nin another 50 years it'll happen again?!\" I couldn't contain myself any more,\\nand I also told him, \"And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew\\nabout it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in \\nSumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received\\ncomplaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did \\neveryone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the \\nway you treated them?\" And he says, \"You know, you're finally starting to \\ninsult me!\" He threw his pen on the desk. \"Maybe now you'll say I'm a \\nscoundrel too?\" I say, \"You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't \\nknow. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that \\ncomrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.\\n\"Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, \\nthat 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had \\ngotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. \\n\"We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of \\nthe Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of \\nArmenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in\\nSumgait.\" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, '\\n\"Well, I walked down the street.\" And I said, \"Walking down the street in any \\ncity, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation\\nbecause I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you \\nspend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't \\nknow you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd \\nhear something quite different.\" I told him, for example, that I drew my \\nconclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took\\nus all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;\\nthey got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the \\nneighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I \\nthought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some\\nanti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it\\nwas the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier \\naccompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything \\nthere were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with\\nus, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young \\npeople, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they \\nwere making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police\\ndetachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and \\ntanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when \\nthe situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they \\nwithdraw protection from the city altogether? There will be more outrages, of \\ncourse, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . .\\n\\n  April 20, 1988\\n  Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

I moved there from\\nNovosibirsk. My son entered the Baku Nautical School, and so I transferred\\nto Azerbaijan. Later I met someone and married him, and now my name is\\nArutunian, my husband's name . . .\\n\\nThat there would be a massacre was not discussed openly, but there were hints \\nand gibes, so to speak, at the Armenian people, and they were mocking the \\nRussians, too. I was constantly aware of it at work, and not just this past \\nyear. I couldn't find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because \\nI, I'll just say it, couldn't steal, couldn't deceive, and couldn't be \\ninvolved in bribe-taking. And when I asked for decent working conditions they \\ntold me, \\\"Leave, don't keep the others from working, you aren't cut out for \\nthis kind of work.\\\" And at work and around all the time I would hear gibes at \\nthe Armenians, like \\\"The Turks had it right, they killed them all--the way\\nthey've multiplied here they're making it hard for us to live,\\\" and \\\"Things \\nwill be just fine if we get rid of them all.\\\" \\\"No problem, the Turks will \\nhelp,\\\" they say, \\\"if we ask them, they'll rid Armenia of Armenians in half an \\nhour.\\\" Well that's the way it all was, but I never thought, of course that it \\nwould spill over into a bloody tragedy, because you just couldn't imagine it. \\nHere we've been living under the Soviet government for 70 years, and no one \\neven considered such an idea possible.\\n\\nBut I had been forming my own opinions, and in the presence of authoritative \\npeople I would often ask, \\\"Where is this all leading, do people really not see\\nwhat kind of situation is emerging here. The Russians are fleeing Sumgait, \\nthere are very few of them left. Why is no one dealing with this, what's going\\non?\\\" And when it all happened on the 27th and 28th, it became clear that \\neverything had been arranged by someone, because what else are you to make of \\nit if the First Secretary of the City Party Committee is marching ahead of the\\ndemonstration with an Azerbaijani flag? I wouldn't be saying this now if I \\nhadn't received personal confirmation from him later. Because when we were \\nunder guard in the SK club on the 1st, he came to the club, that Muslimzade. \\nThe women told me, \\\"There he is, there he is, that's Muslimzade.\\\" I didn't \\nbelieve the rumors that he had carried an Azerbaijani flag. I thought that \\nthey were just false rumors. I went over to him and said, \\\"Are you the First \\nSecretary of our City Party Committee?\\\" He answers me, \\\"Yes.\\\" And I ask him, \\n\\\"Tell me, did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an Azerbaijani \\nflag, and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs, I don't know \\nexactly what they said, but there was mention of Armenian blood?\\\" And he tells\\nme, \\\"Yes, I was there, but I tried to dissuade them from it.\\\" Then I asked him\\nanother question: \\\"And where were you when they were burning and slaughtering \\nus? And he said, \\\"I. . . We didn't know what to do, we didn't know, we didn't \\nanticipate that that would happen in Sumgait.\\\"\\n\\nComrade Mamedov, the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the \\nAzerbaijani SSR, answered the same question for me: \\\"No, we actually didn't \\nanticipate the slaughter in Sumgait. At that time we were trying to contain \\nthe crowd of 45,000 in Baku that was preparing for a massacre.\\\" Those are his \\nexact words, the ones he said in the office of the Council of Ministers of the\\nArmenian SSR.\\n\\nAnd now, about the events themselves. Of course it's painful to discuss them, \\nbecause it may seem that it's not true to someone else. Various rumors \\nconcerning what happened are making the rounds: some are true, others aren't. \\nBut unfortunately there are more true ones than false, because it was so \\nhorrible: in our age, here in the space age, the age of science, the age of\\nprogress, I don't know, if someone had told me this story, if I were living in\\nor around Moscow, I wouldn't have believed it. Why not? Because it was really \\na genocide, it was a massacre. That's genuinely what it was.\\n\\nFor example, on that day, the 28th--I didn't know about the 27th because my \\nhusband and I were both sick, both of us had the flu, and we were in bed--on \\nthe 28th our neighbor comes to our place and says, \\\"You're in bed? You don't \\nknow anything about it? There was a demonstration in town, and after it they \\nwere overturning Armenian cars and burning them. They were looking into cars \\nand asking, 'Are you an Armenian?' If they answered in Armenian, then they \\nturned the car over and burned it.\\\" This isn't made up, the wife of the Senior\\nInvestigator of the Baku Ministry of Internal Affairs told us. He was \\nreturning home from his dacha with his wife, Raisa Sevastyanova, she's my \\nneighbor. She immediately came and told LIS that they had landed right in the \\nmiddle of it, I don't know what to call it, the cavalcade of automobiles they \\nwere stopping. He answered in Azerbaijani, they let them go, but they made him\\nhonk the horn, they were kicking up a fracas. We didn't even believe it, and \\nI said, \\\"Certainly that didn't happen, how can that be?\\\" And she said, \\n\\\"Muslimzade was leading the crowd, and the Sputnik store was completely\\nsmashed because most of the salespeople there are Armenians. And when he saw \\nthat they had started breaking the glass in that store, he said, \\\"Don't break \\nthe shop windows, don't destroy state property, but do whatever else you want.\\n\\\" I didn't hear this with my own two ears, but it is a fact that the store was\\ntorn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing Armenians \\nalthough he's an Azerbaijani.\\n\\nWhile we were talking, all of a sudden right across from us . . . Sevastyanova\\nis the first to look out the window and say, \\\"Look, there's a crowd out \\nthere.\\\" And sure enough, when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had \\nalready started wrecking the neighboring building. There was an Armenian \\nfamily there, a woman and two girls. They lived across from us. I'm sorry, I \\ndon't know the building number or the people's names, since we were in my \\nhusband's apartment, in Microdistrict 8, and I lived in Microdistrict No. 3. \\nThere was awful looting going on there at the time, the most hideous things \\nwere going on there then. One building there, ours, was attacked twice, once \\nwasn't enough for them. They returned to the places where they hadn't finished\\nthe Armenians off. If an Azerbaijani family dared to conceal Armenians, they \\nbeat the Azerbaijanis too. They also beat Russians, if it was Russians doing \\nthe hiding. Because there were Russians among them, they said so on \\ntelevision, there were people of various nationalities. But they didn't tell \\nus why there were people of different nationalities. Because they wouldn't \\nhave touched the Azerbaijanis if they hadn't dared to stick up for the \\nArmenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes.\\n\\nAt the time I saw this from the window I was there, Sevastyanova was there, \\nand so was my husband. We went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly \\noff a balcony. All kinds of things, even a sofa. Then, when it was all down \\nthere, they burned it up. Then we saw the crowd, and they were all oohing. At \\nfirst I couldn't figure out what was happening. And later I told my husband, \\n\\\"Lendrush, l think they're beating someone out there.\\\" And he answered, \\\"I \\ndon't know, could be.\\\" Suddenly the crowd separated for a moment, and I saw \\nit, and Raisa Sevastyanova saw it too. My husband had turned the other way, \\nhe didn't see it. I saw a naked girl with her hair down. They were dragging \\nher. She kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her. She fell \\ndown, it was muddy there, and later other witnesses who saw it from their \\nbalconies told us, they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of \\nblocks, as far as the mortgage bank, that's a good block and a half or two \\nfrom here. I know this for sure because I saw it myself.\\n\\nThen the crowd rushed toward our building. We were standing there, and you can\\nof course imagine what we were feeling. Were they going to kill us or not? And\\nI also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented\\nthat woman, because I had just seen that.\\n\\nI asked my husband. I gave him an axe and said, \\\"You kill me first, and then \\nlet them do what they want with the corpse.\\\" But our neighbors, it's true, \\ndefended us, they said, \\\"There aren't any Armenians in our entryway, go away, \\nonly Muslims live here.\\\" Disaster missed us that time.\\n\\nBut at two o'clock in the morning a crowd of about 15 people, approximately, \\ncame back to our place. My husband was already asleep. He can sleep when he's \\nupset about something, but I can't. I was standing, running from balcony to \\nbalcony. Our power was out, I don't remember for how long, but it was as \\nthough it had been deliberately turned off. There were no lights whatsoever, \\nand I was glad, of course. I thought it was better that way. But then I look \\nand the crowd is at our balcony. This was at 2:15 in the morning. The first \\ntime they were at our building it was 6:30, and now it was 2:15 in the \\nmorning. But I never thought that that old woman on the first floor, the \\nAzerbaijani, was awake and watching out, there were human beings among them \\ntoo. So she goes out with a pail of garbage, as though she needed to be taking\\ngarbage out at two o'clock in the morning. She used it as a pretext and went \\ntoward those young people. They really were youngsters. From my balcony you \\ncould see perfectly that they were young Azerbaijani boys. They spoke \\nAzerbaijani. And when they came up to her she said, \\\"What do you want?\\\" And \\nthey answered, \\\"We want the Armenian family that lives here\\\" [pointing toward \\nthe second floor with their hands]. She says, \\\"I already told you, we don't \\nhave any Armenians here, now leave, do you hear, this is an old Muslim woman \\ntalking to you,\\\" and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around\\nher and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away. And so they \\nseemed to listen to her. They were all very young, they started apologizing \\nand left. That was the second time death was at our door.\\n\\nI forgot to mention about one other apartment, a man named Rubik lives there, \\nI don't know him really, I knew his daughter, I mean I saw her around, but we \\nreally didn't know them. But I do know that that guy who lives on the fourth \\nfloor across from our entryway went to Chernobyl and worked there for eight \\nmonths, to earn money. Can you imagine what that means? He risked his life to \\nearn X amount of money in order to better his family. He bought new furniture \\nand was getting ready to give his daughter's hand in marriage, but, alas,\\neverything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels. They threw everything \\nout the windows, and the rest we saw from our balcony: how the neighbors on \\nthe left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that \\nhadn't already been smashed or taken. What is one to think of that? It means \\nthat the parents in those families were in on it too. Unfortunately I came to \\nbe of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been \\nforeseen in advance: both the beating of the Armenians and the stripping of \\napartments. Something on the order of \\\"We'll move the Armenians out and take \\nover their apartments.\\\"\\n\\nI have worked honestly my whole life, you can check everything about me. I \\ncame as a patriot from China, waited for nights on end in front of the \\nConsulate General of the USSR, I came to my homeland as a patriot because I \\nknew that the Party and the Komsomol were holy things. But when I saw in \\nSumgait that there wasn't anything holy about them, that Party membership was \\nbought, that Komsomol members joined only for personal gain, that there were \\nno ideals, no ideas, God save me, everything was being bought and sold, I saw \\nall of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did.\\n\\nI can't talk any more about it . . . the image of that beating . . . When I\\nwent out of my own apartment--they picked us up under Soviet Army guard, they \\nhad arrived from all over to suppress that gang--not only Armenians, but some \\nRussian families and their children, too, came out of their apartments and\\njoined us, because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with \\nthe situation the way it was. And what's interesting is that when we left on \\nthe buses I rode and thought that at least one group of people, for sure \\npeople would basically rise to the situation, would have some compassion for \\nthe Armenians, would somehow understand the injustice of what was done. But \\nhaving analyzed and weighed the whole thing, once I calmed down, having \\nthought it all through, I came to a conclusion that is shared by many people. \\nIf a lot of Azerbaijanis didn't want their Armenian neighbors to be killed, \\nand that basically depended on that Muslimzade--he said that he had wanted to \\ncalm them down--then is it possible that he didn't have people at hand to whom\\nhe could whisper at the last minute, \\\"Go and announce it on television: \\nCitizens of Sumgait! Take what you can into your hands, let's protect our \\nneighbors from this massacre?\\\" Those crowds weren't such that there was no \\ncontrolling them. Basically they were unarmed. They didn't have firearms, \\nmostly they had knives, they had all kinds of metal parts, like armature \\nshafts, sharpened at the ends, special rocks, different to a degree that we \\nnoticed them: there aren't rocks like those in Sumgait soils, they were \\nbrought from somewhere, as though it were all specially planned. So as I was \\nsaying, I weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend \\nus, why wasn't it arranged? It means that the government didn't want to do \\nit. When the crowd was moving from the City Party Committee to the Sputnik, \\nwhat, there was no way of informing Baku? No, there was no way, it turns out!\\nThe crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict. I won't mention the things \\nI didn't see myself, I'll only talk about the things I myself witnessed. They \\nwere in Microdistrict 8 beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening, when I saw them\\nfrom the other building, and they were somewhere else until mid-night or one \\no'clock in the morning, because at 2:15 they came back to our building. They\\nhadn't completely finished making their predatory rounds of Microdistrict 8. \\nWhen they returned to our building I told my husband, \\\"Lendrush, now the \\npolice are probably going to come, my God, now the authorities are probably \\ngoing to find out and come to our aid.\\\" Well, alas, no, there were to be no \\nauthorities, not a single policeman, not a single fireman, not a single \\nambulance came while they were raging, as it turns out, as we later found out,\\nbeginning on the Might of the 27th. There were dead people, ruined apartments,\\nand burned autos: one car near the bus station, it was burned and overturned, \\nit was probably there about four days, everyone saw it and what went on in \\nBlock 45! Those who live there know, they saw from their balconies how they \\nattacked the soldiers in the buses, how they beat those poor, unarmed\\nsoldiers, and how on that square, I can't remember the name of it, where there\\nis that fork coming from the bus station, that intersection, now I'm upset and\\nI can't think of the name . . . there's a tall building there, a 9-story, and \\nfrom the balconies there people saw that butchery, when the poor soldiers, \\nwearing only helmets, with shields and those unfortunate clubs, moved against \\nthat mob. And when they fell, those 12-to 14-year-old boys ran up and using \\nstones, big heavy stones, beat them to death on their heads. Who could have \\nguessed that something like that could happen in the Soviet Union and under \\nthe Soviet government? The upshot is that this republic has not been under \\nSoviet control for a long time, but no one wanted to pay any attention or get \\ninvolved.\\n\\nIf you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that I tell the\\ntruth, I've been struggling for truth for five years there already, the five \\nyears that I worked at the Azerbaijani railroad. Some people there considered \\nme a demagogue, others who knows what; some think I'm an adventure seeker, and\\nsome, a prankster. But I wanted everything to be right, I would become\\noutraged: how can this be, why is it people treat one another this way on a \\nSoviet railroad, as though the Azerbaijani railroad were Azerbaijani property,\\nor the property of some magnate, or some \\\"mafia\\\": If I want to, I'll get you \\nout of here; If I want to, I'll get rid of you; If I want to, I'll do \\nsomething else? And there's a black market price for everything, in the most \\nbrazen way: a coach to Moscow costs so much, a coach on a local train costs so\\nmuch. Once when I was complaining to the head of the conductor's pool, he had \\nthe nerve to tell me, maybe you won't even believe this, but this, I'm afraid,\\nI heard with my own ears: \\\"Tatyana, just how long can you fight for something\\nthat you know will never have any effect? You're alone against everyone, so \\ninstead why don't you give more money to the chief conductor, and everything \\nwill go fine for you.\\\" I started to cry, turned, and left. What else could I \\ndo, where else could I go to complain? I realized that everything was useless.\\nAnd the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see\\nit. I filed a written complaint, and they ground it into dust, they destroyed \\nit, I still have a copy, but what's the use? When the General Procuracy got \\ninvolved with the investigation of the bloody Sumgait affair, in addition to \\nthe information about what I saw, what I was a witness to, I gave testimony \\nabout the mafia at the railroad. They accepted my petition, but I don't know \\nif they're going to pursue it or not. Because, you'll excuse me, I no longer \\nbelieve in the things I aspired to, the things I believed in before: It's all \\ndead. They just spit on my soul, stomped on everything, physically, and most \\nimportant, spiritually, because you can lose belongings, that's nonsense, that\\nall comes with time, but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in \\nyou--your beliefs--are destroyed, it can be very difficult to restore them...\\n\\nI want to tell of one incident. I just don't know, at the time I was in such a\\nstate that I didn't even take minor things into account. Here is an example.\\nOf course, it's not a minor one. My neighbor, Raisa Sevastyanova, she has a\\nson, Valery, who is in the 9th grade in a school in Microdistrict 8. A boy,\\nVitaly [Danielian], I don't know his last name, goes to school with him, or\\nrather, went to school with him. I was just sitting in an apartment trying to\\nmake a phone call to Moscow . . . Oh yes, and there's one important detail:\\nWhen the massacre began, for two to three hours the phones weren't working in \\nArmenian apartments, and later, in several Russian and Azerbaijani apartments.\\nBut the fact of the matter is that service was shut off, you could not call \\nanywhere. Why? Again, it means it was all planned. How come service is cut off\\nfor no reason? And the lights went off. And those brats were raging as they\\nliked They weren't afraid, they ran about freely, they that no one would slap \\ntheir hands and no one would dare to stop them.  They knew it.\\n\\nNow I'm going to tell about the incident. So this little Vitaly, Vitalik, an\\nArmenian boy, went to school with Valery; they were in the same class. \\nAccording to what Valery and his neighbor pal said--at the time I was in the\\nsame apartment as they were, I sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put\\nthrough--a mob attacked the building where Vitalik lived. So Valery ran to\\nhis mother and said, \\\"Mamma, please let me go to Vitalik's, what if they kill\\nhim? Maybe he's still alive, maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow.\\n. . . He's a nice guy, we all like him, he's a good person, he's smart.\\\" His \\nmother wouldn't let him go. In tears, she says, \\\"Valery, you can't go because \\nI am afraid.\\\" He says, \\\"Mamma, we can get around the crowd. We'll just watch, \\njust have a look.\\\" They made it through. I don't know, I think Vitalik's\\nparents lived in Microdistrict No. 1, and when they got there, they made a \\nsuperficial deduction. Knowing that balconies and doors were being broken \\neverywhere, that you could see from the street which were the Armenian \\napartments in the building, they went here and there and looked, and saw that \\nthe windows were intact, and so they calmed down. But even though the windows \\nin that apartment were not broken, everything inside was totally smashed, and \\nVitalik lay there with a broken skull, and his mother and father had already \\nbeen murdered. Little Vitalik didn't even know they were dead. So two weeks \\nago, I don't know, he was in critical condition, no, maybe it was longer: we \\nleft Sumgait on March 20, spent some time in Moscow, and then we came to \\nYerevan. So it's been about a month already; it's so hard to keep all this \\nstraight. So Valery, the next day, when he found out that Vitalik's family has\\nbeen killed and Vitalik was ling in the Semashko Hospital in Baku, Valery and\\nhis classmates got together and went to visit him. But they wouldn't admit \\nthem, telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in \\na coma. They cried and left, having also found out that the girl I saw being \\nkicked and dragged was in that hospital too. As it turns out she was brought \\nthere in serious condition, but at least she was alive at the time . . .\\n\\nWhen we got to the SK club we would see first one friend and then another, \\nthrow ourselves into their arms and kiss them, because you had wondered if \\nthese friends were alive or not, if those friends were alive or not  . . . And\\nwhen you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived! When\\nyou saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end.\\n\\nIf you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book. A book of \\nthings it is even difficult to believe. And those two girls who were raped \\nwere entirely black and blue, the ones at the SK, they know I'm not lying, \\nthat girlfriend came up to one of them and said, \\\"What happened?\\\" and she \\nbared her breasts, and they were completely covered in cigarette burns . . . \\nthose rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts. After something like that \\nI don't know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it.\\n\\nNow . . . When we stayed at the military unit for a while, they provided,\\nwell, basic conditions for us there. The military unit is located in Nasosny,\\nsome six miles from Sumgait. And living there we met with a larger group\\nof people. There were about 1,600 people at the unit. You know, there was a\\npoint when I couldn't even go outside because if you went outside you saw\\nso much heartbreak around you. And when you hear the false rumors . . .\\n\\nYes, by the way, false rumors were spread in Sumgait saying that the Armenians\\naround Yerevan had destroyed Azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground\\nwith bulldozers. I didn't know whether to believe it or not. And people who \\ndon't know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge. But when \\nI arrived in Armenia and was in Spitak, and in Spitak all those villages are \\nnot only intact, but at that time had even been protected just in case, they \\nwere guarded, they got better food than did the inhabitants of Spitak. Not a \\nsingle person there died, and no one is planning to harm them. Around Yerevan \\nall the villages are safe and unharmed, and the Armenians didn't attack \\nanyone. But actually, after an evil of the magnitude suffered in Sumgait there\\ncould have been a feeling of vengefulness, but no one acted on it. And I don't\\nknow why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the Armenians are \\nguilty, that it is they who organized it. Rumors like that are being spread in\\nAzerbaijan. And if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it, they not\\nonly perceive it with their minds, but with their hearts, too. To them it \\nseems that the older person is telling the truth. For example, one says; \\\"Did \\nyou know that out of 31 people killed (by the way, originally they said 31 \\npeople, but later they found a 32nd), 30 were Azerbaijani and one was an \\nArmenian?\\\"\\n\\nOf course I'm upset, but it's utterly impossible to discuss such things and\\nnot become upset. Sometimes l forget things, but I know I want to return to\\nthe time when we were in the SK club across from the City Party Committee.\\nWhen I saw Muslimzade in the SK club building I went to him to ask because I \\ncouldn't believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner. I already\\nmentioned this, and if I repeat anything, please excuse me. I asked him, \\\"Why \\ndid you do that and why are you here now, why did you come here? To laugh at \\nthese women who are strewn about on the floor?\\\" The overcrowding there was \\ntremendous, it was completely unsanitary, and several of the children were\\nalready sick. It's true the troops tried to make it livable for us. They \\ncooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food, but \\nthe thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at \\nit everywhere, that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere. Plus they \\nwere never given any direct orders, they didn't know what they were authorized\\nto do and not to do. And it was only on March 8 at five o'clock in the evening\\nthat Krayev himself, the Lieutenant General, the City Commandant of Sumgait, \\nwas given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored \\npersonnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do, as his heart \\nadvised him, and relocate people to the military unit.\\n\\nBut that's not what I want to talk about now. Muslimzade, characteristically, \\ntried to get me out of the SK building and take me to the City Party\\nCommittee, which is across the square from the club. He took me by the\\nhand and said, \\\"Citizen, don't worry, we'll go and have a talk in my office.\\nI told him, \\\"No, after everything you've done, I don't believe one iota of \\nwhat you say. If I go to the City Party Committee I'll disappear, and the \\ntraces of me will disappear too. Because you can't stand it when . . . \\\" Oh \\nyes, and there was another interesting detail from that meeting. It was even \\nvery funny, although at the time I wasn't up to laughing. He was in a nice, \\nexpensive hat, and so as to put him to shame, so to speak, I said, \\\"Oh, why \\ndid you come here all duded up like a London dandy, you smell of good perfume,\\nyou're in your starched shirt, and you have your expensive hat on. You came\\nto ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor, who are\\nalready getting sick, whose relatives have died. Did you come to laugh at\\nthem?\\\" And the one who was accompanying him, an Azerbaijani, I don't know who \\nhe was or what his title was, he quickly snatched the hat off Muslimzade's head \\nand hid it. Then I said, \\\"My God! We're not marauders. We're not you! We \\ndidn't come to you with the intention of stealing!\\\" \\\"Well kill me, kill me!\\\" \\nMuslimzade says to me, \\\"But I'm not guilty . . . kill me, kill me, but I'm not\\nguilty.\\\" And I say, \\\"OK, fine, you're not guilty, have it your way. But give \\nus an answer, we're asking you: Where were you when they were torturing and \\nraping those poor women, when they were killing the children, burning things, \\ncarrying on outrageously, and wrecking all those apartments? Where were you \\nthen?\\\" \\\"You know, we didn't expect it, we did not know what to do, we didn't \\nanticipate that something like that would happen in Sumgait.\\\" I started \\nlaughing and said, \\\"It's truly funny.\\\" He says, \\\"What could I do? We didn't \\nknow what to do.\\\" And I say, \\\"I'm sorry, but it'll be ridiculous if I tell \\nyou: The First Secretary of the City Party Committee shouldn't march out in \\nfront with a banner; he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross \\nover his dead body. That's what you should have done. That's the way it was \\nduring the war. Not a single party committee secretary compromised himself;\\neither he died or he led people into battle. And what did you do? You ran \\naway, you left, you hid, you marched with a flag, because you were afraid, \\nexcuse my language, you feared for your own damned hide. And when we ask you, \\nyou tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done? \\nThat's right,\\\" I told him, \\\"the City party committee got confused, all the \\nparty committees got confused, the police got confused,. Baku got confused, \\nthey all lay in a faint for two weeks, and the gang ran the show with \\nimpunity. And if it weren't for the troops it wouldn't have been just two \\ndays, there wouldn't be a single Armenian left in Sumgait for sure, they would \\nhave finished their bloody affair, because they brazenly went up to some \\nRussians, too, the ones who tried to say something to them, and they told \\nthem, 'As soon as we finish with the Armenians we'll come after you, too.\\\"\\n\\nAnd by the way, there was a colonel, who took us to the military unit. He was\\nthe one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later\\narrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the  SK and took us to\\nthe military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit. We \\nasked him, \\\"What? How? What will come of us?\\\" He openly said, \\\"You know, for \\nus the main thing now is to catch that gang. We'll finish that quickly. You'll\\nstay at the military unit for the time being, and we'll decide later.\\\" The \\nGeneral Procuracy of the USSR arrived, it consists of investigators from all \\ncities. There were some from Stavropol, from everywhere, just everywhere, because \\nthe affair was truly frightful. About this, by the way, Comrade Katusev spoke;\\nas everyone knows, he's the First Deputy General Procurator of the USSR. When \\nhe gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit, \\nby the way, he told us the honest truth, because he couldn't not say it, \\nbecause he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen, \\nand he said, \\\"There was Afghanistan; and it was bad, but Sumgait--it's\\nhorrible! And the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely \\npunished, in accordance with our laws.\\\" And that's a quote. Then one mother \\nthrows herself at him--her two sons had died before her very eyes--and says,\\n\\\"Who will return my sons? Who is going to punish the [culprits]?\\\" They tried \\nto calm her down, and he said, \\\"In order for us to conduct a proper \\ninvestigation, in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility, you \\nmust help us, because we don't know, maybe there was someone else in the gang \\nwho is now being concealed in homes, and maybe the neighbors know, maybe \\nsomeone saw something. Don't be afraid, write about it in detail. So that \\nyou're not afraid . . . Everyone knows that many of you are afraid, having \\nlived through such horrors, they think that if they write the whole truth \\nabout, let's say, their neighbor or someone else, that they will seek revenge \\nlater. We're going to do it like this: We're going to set up an urn and you \\ncan throw what you write in there. We don't need to know who wrote it. The \\nnames of the people who write won't be made public, but we need all the\\ninformation. Let each and every one not be afraid, let each write what is \\nnecessary, who they saw in that gang, who made threats or shouted threatening \\ngibes about the Armenians . . . You must describe all of these people and put \\nthe information into the urn.\\\"\\n\\nTwo soldiers and a major guarded the urn. And, sure enough, many people, \\npeople who didn't even want to write . . .I know one woman who asked me, she \\ncame up and said, \\\"You, as a Russian, the same thing won't happen to you as \\nwill happen to me. So please . . . I'll give you the information, and you \\nplease write it down for me.\\\" So she was afraid, and there were a lot like\\nher . . . But later, after Katusev made his speech, she sat and wrote down\\neverything she knew. And we threw it all into the urn. Now we don't know if \\nit will be of any use. For a factual picture will emerge from all that \\ninformation. One person can lie, but thousands can't lie, thousands simply \\ncan't lie. You have to agree with that, a fact is a fact. Why, for example, \\nshould someone say that black is white if it is really black?\\n\\n   The First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijani\\nSSR, Mamedov, as I said, was in Yerevan. My husband and I were at the Council \\nof Ministers of the Armenian SSR and found out that Mamedov was present, the \\none who had come to convince the people of Sumgait to  return to their \\nprevious dwellings, to their old apartments. We asked for a meeting with him, \\nand it was granted. When we went to see him he tried to behave properly, very \\npolitely, delicately, but . . . when the truth was told right to his face and \\nwhen I asked him some of the same questions I had asked Muslimzade, \\\"Where were\\nyou personally when they were beating us? Now you're trying to convince us to \\nreturn, why didn't you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where \\nit was all leading?\\\" he says, \\\"You're telling the truth. Let's not mince \\nwords. You've told me right to my face, and I'll tell you straight. I'll tell \\nyou the pure truth. I was gotten out of bed in the evening, the whole \\ngovernment was up, including me, and we were restraining a crowd of about \\n45,000 in Baku. But we never expected that in a city like Sumgait, with its \\nfine international record, such a thing could happen. We expected it in Baku.\\\"\\nI say, \\\"So that means you expected it all the same? Why were you expecting \\nit?\\\" And he says, \\\"You know, it just happened that way. We were expecting it \\nin Baku, we were trying to restrain it, but in Sumgait . . . \\\" I say, \\\"Fine, \\nyou didn't know for the first three or four hours, but then you should have \\nknown. Why did no one help us?\\\" And he says, \\\"Well, OK, we didn't know what to\\ndo\\\" and things like that. Basically it was the same story I got from \\nMuslimzade. Later, when he said, \\\"You go on back, the situation in Sumgait is \\nfavorable now, everything is fine, the Armenians are friendly with the \\nAzerbaijanis . . . \\\" To this l answered, \\\"You know what . . . I'm speaking \\nwith you as a [member of a] neutral nation . . . I have never argued with \\nArmenians or with Azerbaijanis and I was an eyewitness . . . You tell me, \\nplease, Comrade Mamedov, \\\" I asked him, \\\"What would you say about this\\nhonestly, if you were being completely frank with us?\\\" Then he said, \\\"Yes, I \\nadmit that I am honestly ashamed, shame on the entire Azerbaijani nation, we \\nhave disgraced ourselves not only before the entire Soviet Union, but before \\nthe whole world. Because now the Voice of America and all the other foreign \\nradio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors, too.\\\"\\nAnd I say, \\\"There's nothing to add to what really happened. I don't think it's\\npossible to add anything more awful.\\\" He says, \\\"Yes, I agree with you, I \\nunderstand your pain, it is truly an unfortunate occurrence.\\\" I repeat that he\\nsaid \\\"unfortunate occurrence.\\\" And then he suddenly remembered himself, what \\nhe was saying--he had a pen in his hands, he was fidgeting with it nervously--\\nand said, \\\"Oh, excuse me, a tragedy, really . . . \\\" I take this to mean that \\nhe really thinks it's an \\\"unfortunate occurrence.\\\" \\\"And of course,\\\" he says, \\n\\\"I understand that having gone through all this you can't return to Sumgait, \\nbut it's necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being \\ntried.\\\" And he even gave a detail, which, I don't know if it matters or not, \\nthat 160 policemen were being tried. Specifically in relation to that bloody \\naffair.\\n\\nYes, by the way, there is another good detail, how I was set up at work in\\nBaku after the events. I went to an undergarment plant, there was an \\nAzerbaijani working there, and suddenly she tells me, \\\"What, they didn't\\nnail your husband? They screwed up.\\\" I was floored, I hadn't imagined that\\nanyone in Baku, too, could say something like that. Well after that I went up\\nto see . . . to my office, I needed to find out about those days, what was\\ngoing to happen with them, how they were going to put down those days from \\nFebruary 29 to March 10 . . . and the administrator told me, \\\"I don't know, \\nTatyana, go to the head of the conductors' pool. Be grateful if they don't \\nput it down as unexcused absence.\\\" I was really discouraged by this. They all \\nknow that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived, and here \\nthey're telling me that I was skipping work, as though I was off enjoying \\nmyself somewhere. I went to the office of the chief of the pool, his last name\\nis Rasulov, and he's had that position for many years. Incidentally, he's a \\nParty member, and is a big man in town. And suddenly, when I went to him and \\nsaid, \\\"Comrade Rasulov, this is the way it was . . . \\\" He looked at me askance\\nand said, \\\"And why are you\\\"--he knows me by my previous last name--\\\"why did\\nyou get wrapped up in this mess?\\\" I say, \\\"What do you mean, why did I get \\nwrapped up in this mess? My husband's an Armenian,\\\" I tell him, \\\"I have an \\nArmenian last name.\\\" And he screwed up his face, made a kind of a grimace, as \\nthough he had eaten something sour, and said, \\\"I didn't expect that you would\\n. . . \\\" What did he mean by that? And \\\"how\\\" should he behave, the chief of the\\npool, a man who supervises 1,700 workers? Now, it's true, there was a \\nreduction, but for sure there are still 1,200 conductors working for him. And \\nif someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that, then what \\ncan you expect from a simple, uneducated, politically unsophisticated person?!\\nHe's going to believe any and all rumors, that the Armenians are like this, \\nthe Armenians are like that, and so on . . .\\n\\nBy the way, that Mamedov--now I'm going back to Mamedov's office when I asked \\nhim \\\"Are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return \\nto Sumgait?\\\" he answered, \\\"Yes, you know, I would guarantee them . . . I don't\\nwant to take on too much, I would guarantee them firmly for 50 years. But I \\nwon't guarantee them for longer than 50 years.\\\" I say, \\\"So you've got another\\nthing like that planned for 50 years from  now? So they'll be quiet and then \\nin another 50 years it'll happen again?!\\\" I couldn't contain myself any more,\\nand I also told him, \\\"And how did it get to that point, certainly you knew\\nabout it, how they were treating the Russians, for example, in Baku and in \\nSumgait, how they were hounded from their jobs? Certainly you received\\ncomplaints, I wrote some myself. Why did no one respond to them? Why did \\neveryone ignore what was going on? Didn't you prepare people for this by the \\nway you treated them?\\\" And he says, \\\"You know, you're finally starting to \\ninsult me!\\\" He threw his pen on the desk. \\\"Maybe now you'll say I'm a \\nscoundrel too?\\\" I say, \\\"You know, I'm not talking about you because I don't \\nknow. But about the ones who I do know I can say with conviction, yes, that \\ncomrade was involved in this, that, and that, because I know for certain.\\n\\\"Well anyway he assured us that here, in Yerevan, there were false rumors, \\nthat 3,000 Sumgait Armenians were here, and 15,000 were in Sumgait and had \\ngotten back to work. Everyone was working, he said, and life was very good. \\n\\\"We drove about the town ourselves, Comrade Arutiunian [First Secretary of \\nthe Communist Party of Armenia SSR] came from the Council of Ministers of \\nArmenian, he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in\\nSumgait.\\\" When I asked Mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said, '\\n\\\"Well, I walked down the street.\\\" And I said, \\\"Walking down the street in any \\ncity, even if I were to go to New York, I would never understand the situation\\nbecause I would be a guest, I don't have any contact with people, but if you \\nspend 10 days among some blue-collar workers in such a way that they didn't \\nknow you were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers, you'd \\nhear something quite different.\\\" I told him, for example, that I drew my \\nconclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments. They took\\nus all in turns to pick things up, since people had fled to the military unit;\\nthey got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible. How are the \\nneighbors in the microdistrict, how will they view us, what do they think? I \\nthought maybe that in fact it wasn't something general, of a mass nature, some\\nanti-national something. And when that bus took us to our building, because it\\nwas the same bus, while we were going up to our apartment, an armed soldier \\naccompanied us. What does that say? It speaks of the fact that if everything \\nthere were fine, why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with\\nus, going from apartment to apartment? And in fact, especially with the young \\npeople, you could sense the delight at our misfortune, the grins, and they \\nwere making comments, too. And that was in the presence of troops, when police\\ndetachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and \\ntanks were passing by. And if people are taking such malicious delight when \\nthe situation is like that, then what is it going to be like when they \\nwithdraw protection from the city altogether? There will be more outrages, of \\ncourse, perhaps not organized, but in the alleys . . .\\n\\n  April 20, 1988\\n  Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

have loosened up\\na bit and are discussing this topic as well as the banking/interest\\ntopic.  A few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition\\nto the one you mentioned.  These may be hard to find, but I think I may\\ntake a stab at it out of curiosity.  I know the one film I saw on this\\nsubject was pretty weak and the only two quotes I have seen which were\\nused to show science in the Koran (which I posted here) were also pretty \\nvague.  I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the\\nquotes they have.\\n\\nAt least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivings\\nabout the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science.\\n\\nI wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians\\n\"Creation Science\" on any topic.  It would be interesting to find a history\\nof scientific interpretations of the Koran, to see if anyone used the Koran\\nto support earlier science which has since been discarded.  It is all too\\neasy to look at science as it exists today and then \"interpret\" passages\\nto match those findings.  People do similar things with the sayings of\\nNostradamus all the time.   \n",

Section 1 contains a fairly reasonable\\nanalysis of the Bible, showing many inconsistencies between the Bible\\nand modern science.  Well we all know that, no surprises.\\n\\nSection 2 analyses the Koran's version of the Old Testament stories,\\nand seems, on the face of it, to present a good case showing the Koran\\nis consistent with modern science.  However, it was plain to me, that\\nthis consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the\\nKoran.  Take the flood, for example, the bible is full of detail,\\n(\"forty days and forty nights\", \"pair of every animal\", etc.), we all\\nknow this is nonsense.  The Koran's description of the same event is\\nso obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as \"A big river \\nflooded for a few days and caused much damage\".  Yes, no contradiction\\nbut also not much fact.\\n\\nThe Koran might be consistent with modern science, but being\\nconsistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that\\ntime, does not seem much of an achievement.\\n\\nThe book concludes by saying something like, the Koran must have had\\ndivine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot\\nof (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe, and none of them\\ncan be found in the Koran!  Arguing for the greatness of a book by\\ntalking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme.\\n\\nThe above is, of course, from memory so I may have missed some points.\\n\\n\\n\\n--    \n",

Why do atheists organize in groups?  \\nWhat is there to discuss?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nMany things are discussed here, including:\\n\\n* Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's\\n  family\\n* Prayer in schools\\n* Discrimination against atheists\\n* Sunday trading laws\\n* The Satanic Child Abuse myth\\n* Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet'\\n* How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students\\n* How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers\\n* Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual\\n* Why people become atheists\\n\\nOf course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians\\nlooking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't \\nwant to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure \\nfrom tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Hitler was an atheist!\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nHitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nAdolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:\\n\\n   The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in\\n   his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_\\n   superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_\\n   not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]\\n\\n   For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their\\n   abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the\\n   Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be\\n   active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every\\n   man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who\\n   in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his\\n   religious community and tries to butt into the other.\\n\\n   [...]\\n\\n   Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will\\n   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_\\n   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]\\n\\n          -- Adolf Hitler, from \"Mein Kampf\", trans. Ralph Mannheim.\\n\\nOf course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief\\nwrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \\nto believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, \\nthough.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The Bible proves it\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nIn the Bible it says that...\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed\\n'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The\\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\\naccepted.\\n\\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\\nsubject to \"interpretation\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and\\none thing only is not legitimate.\\n\\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\\n\\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Pascal's Wager\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\\nbut if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\\nhell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.\\n\\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\\ndescribed as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\\n\\nSecondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\\nincorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in\\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\\nfavour of prayer.\\n\\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \\nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \\ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \\nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\\n\\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \\nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \\ncost-benefit analysis.\\n\\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\\n\\n  1. One does not know whether God exists.\\n  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\\n     exist.\\n  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\\n  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\\n\\nThere are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\\nconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\\nno \"cost\".\\n\\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\\nargument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\\nto believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\\nintended the argument to be viewed.\\n\\nThe biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\\na wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\\nwhether people believe in him.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: What is Occam's Razor?\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nPeople keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's \\nRazor.  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \\nunnecessarily.\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\\n\\nNowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it \\nmore generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\\n\\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \\nfor what we see around us:\\n\\n1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\\n\\n2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \\nthere is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \\nof non-zero complexity.\\n\\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest \\nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\\n\\n3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \\nWe just imagine that there is.\\n\\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \\nfind unacceptable.\\n \\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nPreaching is not appreciated.\\n\\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\\nare on a \"conversion\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\\ntalk.religion.misc).\\n\\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\\nhave them do unto you!\\n\\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\\nanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\\nexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.\\n\\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nEinstein did once comment that \"God does not play dice [with the universe]\". \\nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\\nChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's\\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,\\nEinstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\\n\\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\\n\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\\nhuman beings.\"\\n\\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\\nstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,\\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\\n\\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\\nSymposium\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\\n\\n  \"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him\\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\\n   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a\\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\\n\\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\\n   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they\\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\\n   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\\n   more worthy task...\"\\n\\n\\n  \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a\\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\\n   science can reveal it.\"\\n\\nThe latter quote is from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen \\nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  \\nAlso from the same book:\\n\\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \\n   it.\"\\n\\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \\nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Everyone worships something\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nEveryone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about\\nthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for\\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\\nno smallest member.\\n\\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\\nany particular religion.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you\\ndon't think all this appeared here just by chance?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\\n\\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\\n\\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\\nso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,\\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\\nuniverse and life on earth.\\n\\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\\nsurely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \\nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\\ndeliberately.\\n\\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\\nposition.\\n\\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of \"If a creator created the universe,\\nwhat created the creator?\", but with the addition of spiralling \\nimprobability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\\ncreated and just \"is\" (or \"was\").\\n\\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\\njust \"is\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\\n\"A Brief History of Time\", explains his theory that the universe is closed\\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\\n\\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \\nWatchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\\nthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \\nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \\nuniverse too must have a creator.\\n\\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \\nthose common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \\nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \\ncreated the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \\nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\\n\\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \\nthe world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \\nreactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \\nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \\ndifferent part of creation.\\n\\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \\nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \\nstands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \\nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \\nrandom, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus \\ninternally inconsistent.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\\nevidence.  For example...\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\\nevidence.\\n\\nEarly versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many\\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \"reconstructions\" of\\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\\n\\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\\nC.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the\\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is\\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\\n\\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\\nmore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently\\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nGodel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\\nBible to be both true and complete.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nGodel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \\nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \\narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \\nvalid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically\\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \\nsystem.)\\n\\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \"Liar \\nParadox.\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \"This \\nsentence is false.\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \\nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\\n\\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\\n\\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. \\nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\\n\\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show\\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that\\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\\nwithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about\\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\\n\\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\\n\\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\\nboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal\\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman\\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\\nthe press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce\\nfederal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the\\npresidential primary:\\n\\n RS: \"What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?\"\\n\\n GB: \"I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in\\n      God is important to me.\"\\n\\n RS: \"Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of\\n      Americans who are atheists?\"\\n\\n GB: \"No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens,\\n      nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under\\n      God.\"\\n\\n RS: \"Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation\\n      of state and church?\"\\n\\n GB: \"Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not\\n      very high on atheists.\"\\n\\nUPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were\\nstill angry over the remarks.\\n\\nThe exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27,\\n1989.  It can also be found in \"Free Enquiry\" magazine, Fall 1988 issue,\\nVolume 8, Number 4, page 16.\\n\\nOn October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane,\\ncochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a\\nlawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School\\nDistrict 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to\\npledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as \"one nation under God\"\\n(Bush's phrase).

Hell is in Norway!\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThere are several towns called \"Hell\" in various countries around the\\nworld, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly\\namusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now \\ngetting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Biblical contradictions wanted\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nDoes anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?\\n\\nResponse:\\n \\nAmerican Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical\\ncontradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for\\ndetails.\\n\\nThere is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the\\narchive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The USA is a Christian nation\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nBecause of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the\\nUnited States be considered a Christian nation?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nBased upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear\\nthat they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some\\nquotes; there are many more.\\n\\n  \"What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society?\\n   In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the\\n   ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen\\n   upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been\\n   the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert\\n   the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient\\n   auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it,\\n   needs them not.\"\\n      - James Madison, \"A Memorial and Remonstrance\", 1785\\n\\n  \"I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of\\n   the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross.\\n   Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!\"\\n      - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson\\n\\n  \"History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people\\n   maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of\\n   ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will\\n   always avail themselves for their own purpose.\"\\n\\n      - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813\\n\\n  \"I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or\\n   requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely\\n   above it.\"\\n\\n      - Benjamin Franklin, from \"Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion\",\\n        Nov. 20, 1728\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The USA is not a Christian nation\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nIs it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any\\nsense founded upon the Christian religion?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nNo.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty\\nof Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):\\n\\n   Article 11\\n\\n   As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense\\n   founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of\\n   enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as\\n   the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility\\n   against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no\\n   pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption\\n   of the harmony existing between the two countries.\\n\\nThe text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections\\nsuch as Charles Bevans' \"Treaties and Other International Agreements of the\\nUnited States of America 1776-1949\", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).\\n\\nThe English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on\\nJune 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was\\nrecently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the\\nquotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.\\n\\nThe person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul\\nGeneral at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of\\nChristianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there\\nis no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.\\n\\nIn 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the\\nquotation.\\n   \n",

Neil Smith\\n\\n                           WEIRD SCIENCE\\n\\nEveryone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips \\nmove.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are \\npoliticians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase \\n\"political science\" is subject to more than one interpretation.  \\n\\nYears ago, we heard how \"scientists\" were worried that a new Ice \\nAge might be coming, and later on that \"nuclear winter\" -- smoke \\nand dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international \\nunpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even \\nhave killed the dinosaurs.  \\n\\nWhat we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this, \\nthat real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended \\nto discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken \\nvalues that made America the most successful culture in history, \\nand that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague \\nwhen continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.  \\n\\nWe miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William \\nSound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't \\nsupposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least \\n100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never \\nknow it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit \\ntheir agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and \\nthat nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.  \\n\\nBut for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of \\nscience as they are of everything, they trust \"scientists\" to \\nunscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \"scientists\" \\nhave agendas of their own.  \\n\\nNobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is \\ngoing to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that \\nthere is no respectable evidence for \"global warming\".  The money \\nand power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and \\nthey hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical \\ncrisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.  \\n\\nThe same appears true of \"acid rain\", a deliberate hoax cooked up \\nby the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private \\nindustrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and \\nfoisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on \\nspecialists in different fields not talking to each other much.  \\n\\nThe list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.  \\n\"Ozone depletion\", for which evidence is even more suspect and \\ncontradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than \\na last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era \\nwhen state central planning and the command economy have failed and \\ncan only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.  \\n\\nDecades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth \\nand panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear \\npower is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy \\nknown to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount \\nof energy there is available to any individual in society, the \\nfreer that individual -- and his society -- become.  \\n\\nHonest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and \\nself-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as \\nideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive \\nreductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have \\nbeen suppressed, most recently by the California state government.  \\n\\nAnd what the media didn't say about recent EPA \"discoveries\" on the \\neffect of \"secondhand smoking\" is that, although some harm to non-\\nsmokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of \\nmagnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a \\nweek or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether \\nthere was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.  \\n\\nThat, of course, is the real threat represented by politically \\ncorrect science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice \\nto know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy \\npractice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's \\nscience, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is \\nhighly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet \\nthe stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There \\nisn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of \\ngovernment money on the scientific establishment.  \\n\\nTwo centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies \\nto which every other nation in the world has been subject at one \\ntime or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and \\nreligion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has \\ntried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of \\nabortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street \\n-- has wound up being shed.  \\n\\nReal human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's \\nlives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of \\nlivelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate, \\nto diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels \\nfor electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates, \\nwhen they die from the effects of obesity.  \\n\\nWhat we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two \\nmore centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of \\nstate and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable; \\nreal science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will \\nsimply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and \\neveryone will benefit.  \\n\\nL.

I'll post a couple of these a day\\n  unless group concensus demands that I stop, or I run out of good\\n  material.\\n\\n  I haven't been particularly careful in the past about saving\\n  attributions.  I think the following comes from John A. Johnson,\\n  but someone correct me if I'm wrong.  This is probably the longest\\n  of my entire collection.\\n\\n________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\n                                  So that the\\n                                  Prophecy be\\n                                   Fulfilled\\n\\n                                     * * *\\n\\n       In considering the Christian religion, and judging it\\naccording to its claims, it is important to look at its claims at\\nfulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy.  The scribe Matthew is perhaps\\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main\\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\\nwill take particular claims at face value.\\n\\nImmanuel:\\n\\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\\n\\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\\n       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is\\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\\n       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\\n       spoken by a prophet:\\n\\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\\n       lord G'd said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \\n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It\\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\\n       Ahaz said, \"I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a\\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G'd is with us.\"   He will\\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\\n       you dread will have been deserted...\\n\\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \\nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\\nlater Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by\\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\\n\\nEgypt:\\n\\n       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\\n\\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\\n\\n\\nWhat the lord really said was this.\\n\\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \\n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning\\n       incense to idols.\\n\\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it\\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy\\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\\n\\nRachel Weeps:\\n\\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\\n\\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\\n       no more.\"   \\n\\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \\nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance\\nthe message of the church's gospel.\\n       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the\\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd\\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\\nwould not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are\\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\\nconvincing.\\n\\nThe Nazarene:\\n\\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife\\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \\n\\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\\n\\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \\nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that\\nshe will,\\n\\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\\n\\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. \\nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\\nsimple making them up now.\\n\\nBearing our\\nDiseases:\\n\\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\\nand disabilities.\\n\\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\\n       diseases.\"\\n\\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\\n\\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\\n\\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\\nof Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\\ninstrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.\\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel\\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\\n\\n\\nSilent Messiah:\\n\\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse\\nthe attention of the local rulers.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \\n\\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\\n       name.\"\\n\\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\\n\\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\\n       await his law.\\n\\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\\nG'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\\nbe the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at\\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\\n\\nThree Days and\\nThree Nights:\\n\\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\\nresurrection.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\\n       three nights.\\n\\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \\n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that\\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\\n\\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little\\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\\ngod's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\\n\\nHearing &\\nUnderstanding:\\n\\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\\n\\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \\n\\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\\n       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\\n       them.\"\\n\\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \\nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,\\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\\n\\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, \"Go, and say to this\\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\\n       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this\\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far\\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\\n       stump.\\n\\nHere we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel\\nto stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the\\npromise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read\\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\\nof G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\\nof Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't\\nunderstand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are\\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the\\npresent.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face. \\n\\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they\\nhave the prophetic approval.\\n\\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\\n       foundation of the world.\"\\n\\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \\n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\\n       lord...\\n\\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\\nof Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. \\nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\\nof it up.\\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \\nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \\nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\\nMatthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the\\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\\n\\n\\nExcuses of\\nLittle Faith:\\n\\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\\nthey didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\\nwoman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\\n\\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \\n\\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see\\nGod anymore.\\n\\n       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're\\n       sinful; it's just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\\n       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right\\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...\\n\\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear\\nreader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be\\ntrue. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is\\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say\\nour little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they\\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\\nlives of people change... that is seeing G'd.\"   Thus people get\\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday\\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is\\nnot seeing G'd the way people used to see.  \\n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\\nforgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created\\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\\nhas little faith.\\n\n",
              "\\nJesus Rides on\\nan Ass:\\n\\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\\nJerusalem.  \\n\\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\\n       by the prophet, saying,\\n\\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\\n       ass-colt.\"\\n\\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\\ndifferently.\\n\\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\\n\\nThere isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a\\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\\n\\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\\n\\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of\\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'\\n\\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\\nfit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\\nMatthew, \"Haven't you read?\" for the source reads,\\n\\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\\n       enemy and the avenger.\\n\\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,\\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\\njust one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic\\nscripture.\\n\\nYHVH said to \\nmy lord...:\\n\\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\\n\\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\\n\\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\\nnature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one\\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \\nBut, there are problems.\\n       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the\\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's\\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had\\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\\nhis audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and\\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\\n\\n       YHVH's utterance to my lord:\\n\\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\\n       footstool.\"\\n\\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\\n       holy mountains.  \\n\\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\\n       forever.\"\\n\\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an\\naddress of respect.  \\n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\\npoet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the\\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\\nfrom David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive\\ntales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any\\npraises of a messiah.\\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of\\nfavour for David's kingdom on hold.  \\n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\\npromised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \\nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we\\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\\n\\nMoses & Jesus,\\nHad it Together\\nAll Along...:\\n\\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\\npseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John\\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\\nfrom the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. \\nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\\nby G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\\n\\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\\n\\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \\nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\\nwhich corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the\\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\\nstill cling to it.\\n\\nThe Potter's\\nField:\\n\\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn't lawful for\\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter's field with it to\\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\\n\\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's\\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\\n\\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\\nMatthew makes use of.\\n\\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\\n       YHVH.\\n\\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\\nof the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\\nshortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\\nMatthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas \"potter's\\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\\nMatthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\\nintentional dishonesty.\\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if\\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing\\nenough.\\n\\nWine, Vinegar,\\n& Casting Lots:\\n\\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\\n\\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\\n\\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\\n\\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\\n\\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\\n\\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\\n       Book of the Living.\\n\\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\\npsalm asks G'd for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\\nJesus of the gospels says,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\\n       don't know what they do!\"\\n\\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his\\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\\n\\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\\nsay that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no\\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\\nJesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\\nsuspicions.\\n\\nThe 22nd Psalm:\\n\\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\\nwill examine the primary passages.\\n\\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \\n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\\n       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.\\n\\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \\nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much\\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\\nboth day and night on the cross.\\n\\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \\n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\\n\\nThis seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the\\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\\n\\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\\n\\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\\n\\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\\n\\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian\\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\\n\\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\\n       hands and feet...\\n\\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka'ari),\\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka'aru.\"   But, to\\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\\ntranslators.\\n\\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\\npsalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\\nthe forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional\\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.\\n\\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\\ninterpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these\\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\\nthings for St. Matthew.\\n\\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's\\ncrucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after\\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,\\n\\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\\n       \"The will look on him whom they've pierced.\"\\n\\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\\nthem.\\n\\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\\n\\nJohn's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\\nMatthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\\nthan just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and\\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\\nreligion were founded.\\n\\n\n",
              "\\nReckoned with\\nTransgressors:\\n\\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\\n\\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\\n\\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\\n\\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\\n\\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\\n       with him railed, \"Aren't you the messiah?! Save\\n       yourself, and us!\"\\n\\nThis certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the\\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\\n\\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\\n       \"Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same\\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \\n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \\n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\\n\\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\\napparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have\\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\\nLuke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  \\nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\\nwords of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\\nseen.\\n\\nThe End of the\\nWorld--\\n       Mt. 24:\\n\\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\\nwhich he has been warning about.\\n\\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's\\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\\n\\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \\n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\\n       the mountains.\\n\\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\\n       pass away until all these things take place...\\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\\n       at an hour you do not expect.\\n\\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\\nthem that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it\\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \\nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\\nswept away.\\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \\nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\\nhe didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \\nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\\nat the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\\n\\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \\nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\\njust the right moment to spring?\\n\\n\\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best\\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \\nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \\nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\\nChristianity can securely keep hold.   \n",

The hard evidence for my statements about\\nhis lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book\\n\"Orientalism\" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian,\\nnot a Muslim.\\n\\n\\nRegarding Bernard Lewis:\\n\\nHim being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his\\ngiving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.\\n\\nRead \"Orientalism\" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.\\n\\nIn fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).\\n\\n\\nI haven't read Lewis's article, so I can't comment directly upon it, and\\nhave only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his\\npolitical motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic\\npolemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based\\non telling half-truths.\\n\\nAgain, read \"Orientalism\" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take\\nwhat I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get\\nthis book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for\\n_yourself_.\\n\\n\\nIf slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some\\nMuslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual\\npurposes is necessarily opposed too.\\n\\n\\nI understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_\\nwho are not getting through to _you_.\\n\\nSome of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.\\n\\nRegarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject,\\nshowing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been\\ncompletely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a\\nvery good one, under the title \"Islam and Women\", reposted from\\nsoc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,\\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\\nexcellent article.  \\n\\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\\n\\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\\ncompletely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and\\nhadiths to support its point of view.\\n\\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an\\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\\ncourse not.\\n\\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\\nyou.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\\nonly an idiot would think so.\\n\\nDo you see my point?\\n\\n\\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \\ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\\n\\n\\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\\n\\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\\nIslam => lack of education and power.\\n\\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reasons for this situation.\\n\\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\\nfollowing the Qur'an or not.\\n\\n\\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur'an\"\\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\\nfact which contradicts your theory. \\n\\n\\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\\nthis.\\n\\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\\n\\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start\\nthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our\\npostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously\\nhave.   \n",

A few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition\\nto the one you mentioned.  These may be hard to find, but I think I may\\ntake a stab at it out of curiosity.  I know the one film I saw on this\\nsubject was pretty weak and the only two quotes I have seen which were\\nused to show science in the Koran (which I posted here) were also pretty \\nvague.  I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the\\nquotes they have.\\n\\nAt least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivings\\nabout the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science.\\n\\nI wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians\\n\"Creation Science\" on any topic.  It would be interesting to find a history\\nof scientific interpretations of the Koran, to see if anyone used the Koran\\nto support earlier science which has since been discarded.  It is all too\\neasy to look at science as it exists today and then \"interpret\" passages\\nto match those findings.

Section 1 contains a fairly reasonable\\nanalysis of the Bible, showing many inconsistencies between the Bible\\nand modern science.  Well we all know that, no surprises.\\n\\nSection 2 analyses the Koran's version of the Old Testament stories,\\nand seems, on the face of it, to present a good case showing the Koran\\nis consistent with modern science.  However, it was plain to me, that\\nthis consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the\\nKoran.  Take the flood, for example, the bible is full of detail,\\n(\"forty days and forty nights\", \"pair of every animal\", etc.), we all\\nknow this is nonsense.  The Koran's description of the same event is\\nso obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as \"A big river \\nflooded for a few days and caused much damage\".  Yes, no contradiction\\nbut also not much fact.\\n\\nThe Koran might be consistent with modern science, but being\\nconsistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that\\ntime, does not seem much of an achievement.\\n\\nThe book concludes by saying something like, the Koran must have had\\ndivine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot\\nof (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe, and none of them\\ncan be found in the Koran!

Ralph Mannheim.\\n\\nOf course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief\\nwrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed \\nto believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, \\nthough.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The Bible proves it\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nIn the Bible it says that...\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nMost of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable\\naccuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were\\nrecording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed\\n'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The\\nBible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being\\naccepted.\\n\\nMany of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is\\nsubject to \"interpretation\", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and\\none thing only is not legitimate.\\n\\nNote that this feeling tends to extend to other books.\\n\\nIt is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other\\nequally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Pascal's Wager\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing --\\nbut if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\\nhell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.\\n\\nFirstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are\\nmany mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often\\ndescribed as the \"avoiding the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person is a\\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.\\n\\nSecondly, the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\\nincorrect, you have lost nothing\" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in\\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness.\\nConsider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in\\nfavour of prayer.\\n\\nAnother flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that \\nthe two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of \\ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God \\nis close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the\\nargument is only likely to convince those who believe already.\\n\\nAlso, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on \\nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or \\ncost-benefit analysis.\\n\\nFormally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:\\n\\n  1. One does not know whether God exists.\\n  2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does\\n     exist.\\n  3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist.\\n  4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.\\n\\nThere are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an\\nassumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in\\nthe abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is\\nconsidered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no\\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information\\ncan be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates\\ninformation entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at\\nno \"cost\".\\n\\nThe alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The\\nproblem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the\\nChristian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\\nargument thus collapses to \"If you are a Christian, it is in your interests\\nto believe in God\" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal\\nintended the argument to be viewed.\\n\\nThe biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is\\nomniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as\\na wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all\\nwhether people believe in him.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: What is Occam's Razor?\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nPeople keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nWilliam of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's \\nRazor.  In its original form, it said \"Do not multiply entities \\nunnecessarily.\"  That is, if you can explain something without supposing\\nthe existence of some entity, then do so.\\n\\nNowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it \\nmore generally, for example as \"Take the simplest solution\".\\n\\nThe relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations \\nfor what we see around us:\\n\\n1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which\\ncame into being as a result of natural processes.\\n\\n2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and \\nthere is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be \\nof non-zero complexity.\\n\\nGiven that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest \\nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\\nUnfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:\\n\\n3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there.  \\nWe just imagine that there is.\\n\\nThis third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people \\nfind unacceptable.\\n \\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nPreaching is not appreciated.\\n\\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that\\nare on a \"conversion\" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and\\nwill be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup\\ntalk.religion.misc).\\n\\nYou would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite\\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would\\nhave them do unto you!\\n\\nOften theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy\\nanalogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the\\nbasic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell\\natheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it,\\nsince it tells us nothing we have not been told before.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why I know that God exists\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nJust as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship\\nexists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not\\nexist.  That evidence varies from person to person.\\n\\nFurthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many\\npeople have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been\\nabducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Einstein and \"God does not play dice\"\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nAlbert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nEinstein did once comment that \"God does not play dice [with the universe]\". \\nThis quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the\\nChristian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's\\nrefusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore,\\nEinstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.\\n\\nA better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following:\\n\"I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of\\nwhat exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of\\nhuman beings.\"\\n\\nEinstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an\\nobjective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\\nevents and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that\\nQM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for\\nstatistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found,\\nand much evidence suggests that it never will be.\\n\\nA longer quote from Einstein appears in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\\nSymposium\", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\\n\\n  \"The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events\\n   the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side\\n   of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him\\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an\\n   independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a\\n   personal God interfering with natural events could never be\\n   *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this\\n   doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific\\n   knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.\\n\\n   But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives\\n   of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\\n   which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark,\\n   will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\\n   to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers\\n   of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\\n   God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\\n   placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they\\n   will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable\\n   of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\\n   itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably\\n   more worthy task...\"\\n\\n\\n  \"It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions,\\n   a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a\\n   personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly.\\n   If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the\\n   unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our\\n   science can reveal it.\"\\n\\nThe latter quote is from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edited by Helen \\nDukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press.  \\nAlso from the same book:\\n\\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics\\n   to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind \\n   it.\"\\n\\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does \\nnot in itself imply that Christianity is false.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Everyone worships something\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nEveryone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nIf that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about\\nthose things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for\\nexample) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why there must be a causeless cause\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nSets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\\nchains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has\\nno smallest member.\\n\\nFurther, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does\\nnot imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and\\nespecially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by\\nany particular religion.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nThe presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you\\ndon't think all this appeared here just by chance?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis is known as the Argument From Design.\\n\\nIt is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the\\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living\\ncreatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the\\nnewsgroup talk.origins for a while.\\n\\nThere is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here.\\nHowever, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of\\nso-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence,\\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the\\nuniverse and life on earth.\\n\\nThe origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of\\nsomething as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that\\nsurely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some \\nexternal intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos\\ndeliberately.\\n\\nBut if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind\\ncapable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must\\nbe immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the\\nexistence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist\\nposition.\\n\\nThis leads us to the familiar theme of \"If a creator created the universe,\\nwhat created the creator?\", but with the addition of spiralling \\nimprobability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not\\ncreated and just \"is\" (or \"was\").\\n\\nFrom here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe\\njust \"is\" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book\\n\"A Brief History of Time\", explains his theory that the universe is closed\\nand finite in extent, with no beginning or end.\\n\\nThe Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called \\nWatchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on\\nthe beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it\\nevolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the \\nwatch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the \\nuniverse too must have a creator.\\n\\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above \\nthose common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates \\nwatches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have \\ncreated the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are \\nclearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.\\n\\nSecondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in \\nthe world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear \\nreactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument \\nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a \\ndifferent part of creation.\\n\\nFinally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \\nthe watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore \\nstands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \\nargument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not \\nrandom, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus \\ninternally inconsistent.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nThe events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary\\nevidence.  For example...\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary\\nevidence.\\n\\nEarly versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or\\nJames; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many\\nscholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but\\nthat this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several \"reconstructions\" of\\nthe original text have been published to this effect.\\n\\nMuch information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320\\nC.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate\\nfalsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the\\nfirst thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is\\ngenerally given the title of authorship for this material.\\n\\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is\\nmore well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently\\nAsked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nGodel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the\\nBible to be both true and complete.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nGodel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal \\nsystem which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary \\narithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be \\nvalid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically\\nspeaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision\\nprocedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal \\nsystem.)\\n\\nEssentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a \"Liar \\nParadox.\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is \"This \\nsentence is false.\"  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal \\nsystem cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.\\n\\nThe logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims\\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to\\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.\\n\\nOne can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the\\nexistence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. \\nThis is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.\\n\\nIt may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms\\nthat both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show\\nthat Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that\\nwould still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists\\nwithin the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about\\nwhether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.\\n\\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about\\nthe actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.\\n\\nAnother frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates\\nthat a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\\nboth consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal\\nsystems, so such claims are nonsense.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\\n\\nTypical posting:\\n\\nDid George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\\nSherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman\\nis a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of\\nthe press corps.

What may not be equally obvious is that there are \\npoliticians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase \\n\"political science\" is subject to more than one interpretation.  \\n\\nYears ago, we heard how \"scientists\" were worried that a new Ice \\nAge might be coming, and later on that \"nuclear winter\" -- smoke \\nand dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international \\nunpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even \\nhave killed the dinosaurs.  \\n\\nWhat we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this, \\nthat real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended \\nto discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken \\nvalues that made America the most successful culture in history, \\nand that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague \\nwhen continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.  \\n\\nWe miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William \\nSound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't \\nsupposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least \\n100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never \\nknow it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit \\ntheir agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and \\nthat nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.  \\n\\nBut for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of \\nscience as they are of everything, they trust \"scientists\" to \\nunscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's \"scientists\" \\nhave agendas of their own.  \\n\\nNobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is \\ngoing to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that \\nthere is no respectable evidence for \"global warming\".  The money \\nand power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and \\nthey hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical \\ncrisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.  \\n\\nThe same appears true of \"acid rain\", a deliberate hoax cooked up \\nby the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private \\nindustrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and \\nfoisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on \\nspecialists in different fields not talking to each other much.  \\n\\nThe list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.  \\n\"Ozone depletion\", for which evidence is even more suspect and \\ncontradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than \\na last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era \\nwhen state central planning and the command economy have failed and \\ncan only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.  \\n\\nDecades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth \\nand panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear \\npower is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy \\nknown to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount \\nof energy there is available to any individual in society, the \\nfreer that individual -- and his society -- become.  \\n\\nHonest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and \\nself-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as \\nideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive \\nreductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have \\nbeen suppressed, most recently by the California state government.  \\n\\nAnd what the media didn't say about recent EPA \"discoveries\" on the \\neffect of \"secondhand smoking\" is that, although some harm to non-\\nsmokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of \\nmagnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a \\nweek or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether \\nthere was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.  \\n\\nThat, of course, is the real threat represented by politically \\ncorrect science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice \\nto know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy \\npractice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's \\nscience, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is \\nhighly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet \\nthe stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There \\nisn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of \\ngovernment money on the scientific establishment.  \\n\\nTwo centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies \\nto which every other nation in the world has been subject at one \\ntime or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and \\nreligion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has \\ntried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of \\nabortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street \\n-- has wound up being shed.  \\n\\nReal human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's \\nlives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of \\nlivelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate, \\nto diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels \\nfor electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates, \\nwhen they die from the effects of obesity.  \\n\\nWhat we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two \\nmore centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of \\nstate and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable; \\nreal science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will \\nsimply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and \\neveryone will benefit.  \\n\\nL.

The scribe Matthew is perhaps\\nthe most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in\\nthe career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main\\nstrategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even\\nabout the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in\\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\\nauthenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at\\nleast 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much\\nhappened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we\\nwill take particular claims at face value.\\n\\nImmanuel:\\n\\n       We begin, of course, at the beginning.\\n\\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\\n       Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is\\n       salvation), for he will save his people from their\\n       sins.\"  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had\\n       spoken by a prophet:\\n\\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\\n       and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its\\n       heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the\\n       lord G'd said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \\n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\\n       naturally) saying, \"Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It\\n       can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.\"  But,\\n       Ahaz said, \"I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a\\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\\n       David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that\\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\\n       is with child and will bear a son, and name him\\n       \"Immanuel,\" which means, \"G'd is with us.\"   He will\\n       eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil\\n       and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to\\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings\\n       you dread will have been deserted...\\n\\nMatthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. \\nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), as\\nspecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, this is not a prophecy about the\\nMessiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years\\nlater.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\\nshort, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of\\ncontext, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\\nshould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\\nvirgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course,\\nthe fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by\\nlater Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by\\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy\\nfor Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\\nclass prophecy.   Not too convincing.\\n\\nEgypt:\\n\\n       After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a\\nquick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he\\nwishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an\\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\\n\\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\\n       Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.\"\\n\\n\\nWhat the lord really said was this.\\n\\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. \\n       And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called\\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\\n       kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning\\n       incense to idols.\\n\\nMatthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it\\nwas indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\\nreturn.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of\\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\\nup with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy\\nis just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.\\n\\nRachel Weeps:\\n\\n        While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that\\nKing Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of\\nall young male children.  Matthew then writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the\\n       prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:\\n\\n       \"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\\n       she refused to be consoled, because they were\\n       no more.\"   \\n\\nThe reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\\ncarrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim,\\nand Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are \"no\\nmore.\"  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies\\nbefore the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile.\\n       It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who\\nwas the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and\\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her \"children,\"\\nit is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is\\nthat the legends have it that she was buried north of the city,\\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\\n       As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely\\nthat such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the\\nevent is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible,\\nnor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. \\nHerod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less\\nevil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a\\nprime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance\\nthe message of the church's gospel.\\n       Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the\\ninfant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set\\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus.\\nIt is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention\\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\\nspeaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd\\ncomforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be\\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this\\nwould not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are\\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew sets up is not even\\nthat, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too\\nconvincing.\\n\\nThe Nazarene:\\n\\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph &amp; wife\\ntake the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth, \\n\\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets\\n       might be fulfilled, \"He shall be called a Nazarene.\"\\n\\nFirst thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of\\nthe prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" is. \\nThere are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse,\\nthere are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\\nworse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at\\nall.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that\\nshe will,\\n\\n       [Judges 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\\n       shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his\\n       god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel\\n       from the hands of the Philistines.\"\\n\\nThis is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. \\nBut, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has\\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is\\nsimple making them up now.\\n\\nBearing our\\nDiseases:\\n\\n       Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses\\nand disabilities.\\n\\n       [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the\\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmities and bore our\\n       diseases.\"\\n\\nAs expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context,\\nand a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\\n\\n       [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has\\n       borne our sickness, and carried our pains.\\n\\nFrom a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that\\nthe prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation\\nof Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the\\nIsraelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations\\nthat look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish\\nidentity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the\\ninstrument of the nations' salvation by G'd.\\n      The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which\\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and\\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" going around and\\nhealing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the\\nsicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus,\\nas we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The\\nverses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but\\nrather something that had already happened.  While it is believed\\nthat Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\\nthe illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say\\nthat, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his\\nspiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel\\nmisses where he intended it to have its effect.\\n\\n\\nSilent Messiah:\\n\\n      Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus\\nordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse\\nthe attention of the local rulers.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by\\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \\n\\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved,\\n       with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on\\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He\\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\\n       his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised\\n       reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings\\n       justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his\\n       name.\"\\n\\nThe Isaiah passage quoted reads,\\n\\n       [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\\n       chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my\\n       spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the\\n       nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or\\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\\n       bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will\\n       faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail\\n       (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has\\n       established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands\\n       await his law.\\n\\nYou see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage,\\nbecause it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could\\nnever think of Jesus failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\\nburn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to\\nan end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace\\nG'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\\nbe the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed\\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coastlands await his law.\" to the\\nChristologic, \"the Gentiles will hope in his name.\"   While the\\noriginal proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it\\nto fit its strange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\\nhas any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only\\nto read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved\\nbut blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robbed and\\nplundered...\"   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at\\n\"prophecy\" is examined, it crumbles.\\n\\nThree Days and\\nThree Nights:\\n\\n      Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very\\nmouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and\\nresurrection.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the\\n       whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son\\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and\\n       three nights.\\n\\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know\\nhow the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was\\n24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset\\n6pm.  What was referred to as a \"day\" was the period of light from\\n6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time\\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until\\n6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their\\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. \\n(It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that\\nSaturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus,\\nwhen days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\\nportions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus,\\nJesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\\nunresurrected for three days and three nights.\\n\\n      As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the \"ninth\\nhour,\" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the\\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, \"rose,\"\\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was\\nover).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for\\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\\n6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm\\nFriday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means\\nusing Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two\\nnights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this\\nis a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we\\nare even able to have his death involve three days and three\\nnights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to\\nsuspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little\\nmistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his\\ngod's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more\\nthan unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.\\n\\nHearing &amp;\\nUnderstanding:\\n\\n     Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in\\nparables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\\nmessage of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the\\nparables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand\\nthem, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not\\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew says,\\n\\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\\n       fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says, \\n\\n       \"You will indeed hear but never understand; and you\\n       will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this\\n       people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of\\n       hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they\\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and\\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\\n       them.\"\\n\\nThe original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his\\ncall to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is\\nflourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. \\nIsaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd,\\ncalling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.\\n\\n       [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, \"Go, and say to this\\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\\n       see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this\\n       people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their\\n       eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear\\n       with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and\\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the cities lie waste\\n       without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the\\n       land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far\\n       away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And\\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\\n       stands when the tree is felled.\" The holy seed is its\\n       stump.\\n\\nHere we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel\\nto stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the\\npromise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read\\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan\\nof G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look\\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\\n     We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion\\nof Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that,\\nhe has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't\\nunderstand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are\\nnot prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the\\npresent.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face. \\n\\n     Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they\\nhave the prophetic approval.\\n\\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a\\n       parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the\\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I\\n       will utter that which has been hidden since the\\n       foundation of the world.\"\\n\\nMatthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a\\nprophet, but from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\\n       utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have\\n       heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. \\n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\\n       the coming generation the glorious deeds of the\\n       lord...\\n\\nAs was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come\\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies\\nof Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. \\nApparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some\\nof it up.\\n     Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once\\nagain, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus\\nhas said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not\\nunderstand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. \\nFurther, they speak of things \"known, that our fathers have told\\nus.\"  Jesus deals with things \"hidden since the foundation of the\\nworld.\"  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \\nThis is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No\\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\\nMatthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But,\\nChristians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the\\nonly things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.\\n\\n\\nExcuses of\\nLittle Faith:\\n\\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go\\naround casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what\\nepilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were\\npossesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were\\nunable to \"dispossess\" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more\\nenlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying\\nthey didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this\\ndemon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or\\nhe does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move\\nmountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can\\nmove real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the\\nCharismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to\\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old\\nwoman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.\\n\\n       And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in\\nancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their\\nsacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in\\nheaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and\\ntheir great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  \\n\\n     Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time\\nor a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the\\nold days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\\ntheologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see\\nGod anymore.\\n\\n       We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're\\n       sinful; it's just his \"plan\"; we put too many of our\\n       own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right\\n       faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...\\n\\n     Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear\\nreader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be\\ntrue. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your\\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is\\nmake people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say\\nour little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they\\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\\nlives of people change... that is seeing G'd.\"   Thus people get\\nlulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday\\nsights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is\\nnot seeing G'd the way people used to see.  \\n      What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of\\nhuman hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the\\nforgiveness practised by Christian &amp; Atheist alike, beauty created\\nby the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are\\nwhat we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody\\nhas little faith.\\n\f\\nJesus Rides on\\nan Ass:\\n\\n       Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah\\nking, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\\nJerusalem.  \\n\\n       [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken\\n       by the prophet, saying,\\n\\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your king is\\n       coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a\\n       ass-colt.\"\\n\\nOf course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little\\ndifferently.\\n\\n       Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and\\n       victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass-\\n       colt... he will command peace to the nations.\\n\\nThere isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\\nonly involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the\\npoetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for\\nboth a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a\\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two\\ndonkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological,\\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to\\nJesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and\\nshows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has\\nbungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I\\nhave noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses,\\nthe situation is often reversed nowadays...\\n\\n       Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were\\nangered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But,\\nJesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,\\n\\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of\\n       babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'\\n\\nIt is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus\\nwas never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" things AND\\nsince, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to\\nfit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or\\nMatthew, \"Haven't you read?\" for the source reads,\\n\\n       [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is\\n       your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is\\n       chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you\\n       have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the\\n       enemy and the avenger.\\n\\nThe passages hardly need comment.  There is no \"perfect praise\"\\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd,\\nnot his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be\\njust one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic\\nscripture.\\n\\nYHVH said to \\nmy lord...:\\n\\n      Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish\\nmessiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king\\nDavid.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,\\n\\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\\n       I put your enemies under your feet.\"\\n\\nTaken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic\\ndescent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of\\ncourse, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to\\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\\nnature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one\\nis a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. \\nBut, there are problems.\\n       In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the\\nmessiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the\\nmessiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures\\nabout the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king,\\nbringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's\\nrule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the\\npassage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the\\nChristians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this\\npsalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had\\nalso made.  One must remember that there were various factions\\namong the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the\\nmessiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like\\nhis audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and\\nwho interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic.\\nWhat is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,\\n\\n       YHVH's utterance to my lord:\\n\\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your\\n       footstool.\"\\n\\n       YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\\n       in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer\\n       themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the\\n       holy mountains.  \\n\\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\\n       forever.\"\\n\\nThe word \"lord\" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian\\nbibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\\nword is \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means\\n\"lord,\" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in\\nthe scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an\\naddress of respect.  \\n      There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word\\nrefers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is\\nsupposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the\\npsalm translates to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\\nDavid.\"  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court\\npoet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the\\npsalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be\\ntalking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended\\nfrom David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive\\ntales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any\\npraises of a messiah.\\n     Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after\\nDavid was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of\\nfavour for David's kingdom on hold.  \\n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was\\npromised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies,\\nsuccessful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved\\nthe priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king,\\nenabled to bless the people.   It all fits.\\n      We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone,\\nthough.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\\nhis use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this\\nevent is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off\\na little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note,\\nthough, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of\\nMark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. \\nMatthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of\\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we\\nmight expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by\\nembarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.\\n\\nMoses &amp; Jesus,\\nHad it Together\\nAll Along...:\\n\\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a\\npseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John\\ndeserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed\\nfrom the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. \\nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early\\nchurch leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah\\nking, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made\\nby G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of\\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this\\nwas accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the\\nChristians who came along later decided that they would claim the\\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the\\npromise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\\n\\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham,\\n       rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.\\n\\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but,\\nAbraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. \\nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament\\nwhich corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the\\ncourse to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like\\nhis forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has\\nmany of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they\\nstill cling to it.\\n\\nThe Potter's\\nField:\\n\\n      We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by\\none of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,\\n\\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver\\n       in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief\\n       priests, taking the silver, said, \"It isn't lawful for\\n       us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood\\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter's field with it to\\n       bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was\\n       spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\\n\\n       \"And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price\\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\\n       sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's\\n       field, as the lord directed me.\"\\n\\nThis prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament\\nScripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name\\nof the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which\\nMatthew makes use of.\\n\\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages,\\n       thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lordly price at which I\\n       was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of\\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\\n       YHVH.\\n\\nFirst of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\\nof the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely\\na priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people\\nshortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replaced by the King\\nJames Scholars with \"to the potter,\" precisely because this made\\nMatthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The\\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew is indeed \"treasury,\" which also\\nmakes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas \"potter's\\nfield\" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was\\nintentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given\\nMatthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of\\nintentional dishonesty.\\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the\\ntext.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if\\nas most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard\\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\\ntoss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\\ndirectly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high\\npriests.  The high priests would not put the money in the\\ntreasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the\\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\\nthe \"prophecy\" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New\\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing\\nenough.\\n\\nWine, Vinegar,\\n&amp; Casting Lots:\\n\\n      Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.\\n\\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\\n       mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not\\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\\n       divided his garments among them by casting lots: that\\n       it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,\\n\\n       \"They parted my garments among them, and upon my\\n       vesture did they cast lots.\"\\n\\nFirst of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour\\nwine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find\\nthat right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him\\nsome to drink --not polluted with gall.\\n\\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he\\n       had received the vinegar, he said, \"It is finished;\"\\n\\nBut, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the\\nprophets, but one from the Psalms.\\n\\n       [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none;\\n       and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me\\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\\n       Book of the Living.\\n\\nOf course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request\\nof drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\\nquoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It\\nis not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that\\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesus\" in the\\npsalm asks G'd for the damnation of the \"crucifiers,\" whereas the\\nJesus of the gospels says,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, \"Father, forgive them, the\\n       don't know what they do!\"\\n\\nFurther, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by\\nhaving gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his\\nmeat, as the psalm stipulates.\\n\\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\\nask, \"What of the casting of lots?\"  This brings up the 22nd\\nPsalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\\nsay that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no\\ngreat thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon\\nin those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least\\nerroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does\\nindeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of\\nJesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions,\\nhis ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some\\nsuspicions.\\n\\nThe 22nd Psalm:\\n\\n      This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his\\ncondition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of\\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it\\nseem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We\\nwill examine the primary passages.\\n\\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \\n       Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words\\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\\n       don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.\\n\\nJesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. \\nThis suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather\\nthan king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not\\nfit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as\\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like \"the\\nlamb led mute before its shearers.\"  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much\\ngroaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by\\nboth day and night on the cross.\\n\\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... \\n       All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag\\n       their heads;  \"He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let\\n       him deliver him... for he delights in him.\"\\n\\nThis seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the\\nexception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.\\n\\n       12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their\\n       mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\\n\\n       16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and\\n       feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my\\n       garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\\n\\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\\n       afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!\\n\\nIt would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian\\nfathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately,\\nthis prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words \"have pierced\" really\\ndo not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,\\n\\n       16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my\\n       hands and feet...\\n\\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\\nword in the Hebrew text is literally, \"like the lion\" (ka'ari),\\nwhich makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal\\nimagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that\\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka'aru.\"   But, to\\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" this is\\njust what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the\\ncorrect translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to\\nJesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the\\ntranslators.\\n\\n       Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend\\nitself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being\\nsaved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the\\npsalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know\\nthat crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather\\nthe forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional\\nthought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on\\nhis palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.\\n\\n      Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not\\nattempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord\\nJesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all\\nthe gospel writers when they compiled the stories and\\ninterpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these\\nscriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down\\nis a question that has serious repercussions for Christian\\ntheology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful\\nfundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might\\nhave been \"enhanced\" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But,\\nit does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural\\nmatters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good\\nthings for St. Matthew.\\n\\nThe reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's\\ncrucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after\\nthe fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,\\n\\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his\\n       side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\\n       these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\\n       \"The will look on him whom they've pierced.\"\\n\\nOf course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of\\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of\\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\\nthem.\\n\\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations\\n       that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\\n\\nJohn's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that\\nMatthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more\\nthan just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and\\nblatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel\\nwriters, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their\\nreligion were founded.\\n\\n\f\\nReckoned with\\nTransgressors:\\n\\n       After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming\\nthe Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of\\nthe gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.\\n\\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers,\\n       one on his right, one on his left.  And so the\\n       scripture was fulfilled which says,\\n\\n       \"He was reckoned with the transgressors.\"\\n\\nHere, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53,\\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the\\nmessiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its\\nsurrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The\\nverses are also about what this servant has gone through in the\\npast, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The\\nservant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the\\ndescription of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the\\nmessiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between\\ntwo thieves would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesus would\\nmore fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was\\nconsidered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his\\ncareer.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to\\nsteal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could\\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparisons.\\n\\n       Mark goes on to tell us how \"those who were crucified with\\n[Jesus] also reviled him.\" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a\\ncouple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke\\ndecides to change some things.  Luke tells us,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged\\n       with him railed, \"Aren't you the messiah?! Save\\n       yourself, and us!\"\\n\\nThis certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the\\npeople who crucified Jesus said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\\nrobbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,\\n\\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying,\\n       \"Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same\\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so,\\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. \\n       But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said,\\n       \"Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \\n       And Jesus answered, \"Verily I say to you, today you\\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\\n\\nNow, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches\\nthe imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking\\nhis fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\\nstrange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his\\npunishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man,\\napparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have\\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by\\nLuke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's.  \\nLuke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy\\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made\\nup, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free\\nwords of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another\\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and\\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case,\\nthe embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have\\nseen.\\n\\nThe End of the\\nWorld--\\n       Mt. 24:\\n\\n       Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and\\nembarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all\\nthree of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most\\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus\\nmentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and\\nhis disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world\\nwhich he has been warning about.\\n\\n       The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's\\n       destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\\n       coming, and of the close of the age?\\n\\n       Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for\\n       many will come in my name, saying, \"I am the christ.\"  \\n       ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for\\n       this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For,\\n       nation will rise against nation... all this is but the\\n       beginning of the birthpangs.\\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\\n       and false prophets will arise and lead many astray.\\n       ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This\\n       gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\\n       testimony to the nations, and then the end will come.\\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\\n       the mountains.\\n\\n             Immediately after the tribulation of those days,\\n       the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from\\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\\n       in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn,\\n       and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out\\n       his angels... and gather his elect...\\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its\\n       branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know\\n       that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these\\n       things, you will know that He is near, at the very\\n       gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not\\n       pass away until all these things take place...\\n             But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the\\n       angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming\\n       at an hour you do not expect.\\n\\nFrom this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in\\nwithin the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells\\nthem that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it\\nwill come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet\\ntheir pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. \\nBut, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his\\ndisciples that their generation would still be around at the End,\\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\\nswept away.\\n      There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant\\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"this generation\\nshall not pass away...\" really means \"this race of people will not\\npass away...\"  Of course, the word for generation is used many\\ntimes to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. \\nIt is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\\nhe didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is\\nquite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at\\nleast some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. \\nThe charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking\\nat the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from\\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus\\nmeant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.\\n\\n       For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th\\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000\\nyears, they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\\nhearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. \\nSurely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how\\ntired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for\\njust the right moment to spring?\\n\\n\\n       So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth,\\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or\\nthree days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three\\neternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for\\nless trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine\\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best\\ninterests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore\\ndisappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. \\nAs has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when\\npeople got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them,\\nJesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\\nseen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout\\nChurch history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple\\nbelief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with\\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away\\nfrom question.  To question and investigate has never been the\\neasiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the\\nprophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely\\naccepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. \\nPausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity\\nhave been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support\\nwars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which\\nChristianity can securely keep hold.</td>\n",

The hard evidence for my statements about\\nhis lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book\\n\"Orientalism\" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian,\\nnot a Muslim.\\n\\n\\nRegarding Bernard Lewis:\\n\\nHim being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his\\ngiving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.\\n\\nRead \"Orientalism\" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.\\n\\nIn fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).\\n\\n\\nI haven't read Lewis's article, so I can't comment directly upon it, and\\nhave only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his\\npolitical motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic\\npolemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based\\non telling half-truths.\\n\\nAgain, read \"Orientalism\" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take\\nwhat I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get\\nthis book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for\\n_yourself_.\\n\\n\\nIf slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some\\nMuslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual\\npurposes is necessarily opposed too.\\n\\n\\nI understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_\\nwho are not getting through to _you_.\\n\\nSome of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.\\n\\nRegarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject,\\nshowing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been\\ncompletely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a\\nvery good one, under the title \"Islam and Women\", reposted from\\nsoc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,\\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\\nexcellent article.  \\n\\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\\n\\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\\ncompletely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and\\nhadiths to support its point of view.\\n\\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an\\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\\ncourse not.\\n\\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\\nyou.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\\nonly an idiot would think so.\\n\\nDo you see my point?\\n\\n\\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \\ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\\n\\n\\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\\n\\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\\nIslam =&gt; lack of education and power.\\n\\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reasons for this situation.\\n\\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\\nfollowing the Qur'an or not.\\n\\n\\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur'an\"\\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\\nfact which contradicts your theory. \\n\\n\\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\\nthis.\\n\\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\\n\\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start\\nthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our\\npostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously\\nhave.</td>\n",

A few books on the subject have also been mentioned in addition\\nto the one you mentioned.  These may be hard to find, but I think I may\\ntake a stab at it out of curiosity.  I know the one film I saw on this\\nsubject was pretty weak and the only two quotes I have seen which were\\nused to show science in the Koran (which I posted here) were also pretty \\nvague.  I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the\\nquotes they have.\\n\\nAt least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivings\\nabout the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science.\\n\\nI wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians\\n\\\"Creation Science\\\" on any topic.  It would be interesting to find a history\\nof scientific interpretations of the Koran, to see if anyone used the Koran\\nto support earlier science which has since been discarded.  It is all too\\neasy to look at science as it exists today and then \\\"interpret\\\" passages\\nto match those findings.  People do similar things with the sayings of\\nNostradamus all the time.\",\n          \"\\n\\nThis book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue.\\n\\n\\nThe book is in two sections.  Section 1 contains a fairly reasonable\\nanalysis of the Bible, showing many inconsistencies between the Bible\\nand modern science.  Well we all know that, no surprises.\\n\\nSection 2 analyses the Koran's version of the Old Testament stories,\\nand seems, on the face of it, to present a good case showing the Koran\\nis consistent with modern science.  However, it was plain to me, that\\nthis consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the\\nKoran.  Take the flood, for example, the bible is full of detail,\\n(\\\"forty days and forty nights\\\", \\\"pair of every animal\\\", etc.), we all\\nknow this is nonsense.  The Koran's description of the same event is\\nso obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as \\\"A big river \\nflooded for a few days and caused much damage\\\".  Yes, no contradiction\\nbut also not much fact.\\n\\nThe Koran might be consistent with modern science, but being\\nconsistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that\\ntime, does not seem much of an achievement.\\n\\nThe book concludes by saying something like, the Koran must have had\\ndivine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot\\nof (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe, and none of them\\ncan be found in the Koran!  Arguing for the greatness of a book by\\ntalking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme.\\n\\nThe above is, of course, from memory so I may have missed some points.\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \",\n          \"\\n\\nYou misrepresent me, Selim.  The hard evidence for my statements about\\nhis lack of objectivity are presented quite clearly in the book\\n\\\"Orientalism\\\" by Edward Said.  Edward Said, by the way, is a Christian,\\nnot a Muslim.\\n\\n\\nRegarding Bernard Lewis:\\n\\nHim being a Zionist gives him a political motive for his\\ngiving misrepresentations and half-truths about Islam.\\n\\nRead \\\"Orientalism\\\" by Edward Said -- see the evidence for yourself.\\n\\nIn fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).\\n\\n\\nI haven't read Lewis's article, so I can't comment directly upon it, and\\nhave only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his\\npolitical motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic\\npolemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based\\non telling half-truths.\\n\\nAgain, read \\\"Orientalism\\\" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take\\nwhat I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get\\nthis book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for\\n_yourself_.\\n\\n\\nIf slavery is _in reality_ (as opposed to in the practice of some\\nMuslims) opposed by Islam, then using slaves for sexual\\npurposes is necessarily opposed too.\\n\\n\\nI understand your point of view, Selim -- I think, rather, it is _us_\\nwho are not getting through to _you_.\\n\\nSome of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.\\n\\nRegarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject,\\nshowing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been\\ncompletely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a\\nvery good one, under the title \\\"Islam and Women\\\", reposted from\\nsoc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site,\\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\\nexcellent article.  \\n\\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\\n\\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\\ncompletely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and\\nhadiths to support its point of view.\\n\\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an\\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\\ncourse not.\\n\\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\\nyou.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \\\"I am a\\nMuslim\\\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\\nonly an idiot would think so.\\n\\nDo you see my point?\\n\\n\\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \\ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\\n\\n\\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\\n\\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\\nIslam => lack of education and power.\\n\\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reasons for this situation.\\n\\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\\nfollowing the Qur'an or not.\\n\\n\\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \\\"following the Qur'an\\\"\\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\\nfact which contradicts your theory. \\n\\n\\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\\nthis.\\n\\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\\n\\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start\\nthinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our\\npostings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously\\nhave.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"talk.politics.guns\",\n          \"alt.atheism\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It uses freon jets for\\nsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie\\nduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much\\ncontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also\\nneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and\\nflip the payload around to look at the Sun.\\n\\nWe have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speaking\\nonly from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how\\nmuch freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have\\nextra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.\\n\\nThis should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas \\nquantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and I'll try to get you\\nin touch with our ground crew people.\\n\\nCheers,\\nCraig\\n   \n",

It uses freon jets for\\nsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie\\nduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much\\ncontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also\\nneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and\\nflip the payload around to look at the Sun.\\n\\nWe have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speaking\\nonly from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how\\nmuch freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have\\nextra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.\\n\\nThis should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas \\nquantity.

It uses freon jets for\\nsteering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie\\nduring our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much\\ncontinuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also\\nneed to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and\\nflip the payload around to look at the Sun.\\n\\nWe have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speaking\\nonly from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how\\nmuch freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have\\nextra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.\\n\\nThis should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas \\nquantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and I'll try to get you\\nin touch with our ground crew people.\\n\\nCheers,\\nCraig\\n\",\n          \"I wrote :\\n  Nice strawman indeed.  The discussion is not about whether there were\\ntanks\\n  used in sixties riots; instead, it is about whether those tanks fired\\ntheir\\n  main guns in one of those riots.  You claim they did.  That claim is\\n  ludicrous.\\n\\nAwesley replied:\\n     I repeated what I had been told, under what context I had heard it,\\n  supporting the claim that tanks were indeed used in Detroit in 67.\\n\\nThe issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It\\nhas been whether they fired their main guns.  You did not merely claim that\\ntanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress\\nsniper fire and that they were \\\"quite\\\" effective at this.  You continue to\\nback away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is\\ndisputing.\\n\\nAwesley went on:\\n  I\\n  spent a few minutes in a library today -- found their computer was\\n  down and they don't have a card catalog.  Anyway, it took about 10\\n  minutes to find this in _Nightmare in Detroit, A Rebellion and It's\\n  Victims_ by Sauter and Hines, on page 133, telling of the death of\\n  Tonia Blanding, age 4.\\n   \\n        \\\"When the tank was fired upon by snipers it turned in the direction\\n  the shots came from. [...] the fifty-caliber machine gun mounted on the\\n  tank belched fire into the buildings.  After a short round into the front\\n  of the buildings, the tank guns spit again, tearing apart huge holes out\\n  of the side of the apartment.\\\"\\n  \\n       Well, it's not the main gun.  \\n\\n\\\"Well, it's not the main gun.\\\"  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you\\nnow going to admit that you were wrong?\\n\\n  will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main\\n  guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I\\nread\\n  the reports of the tank fire?  I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won't. \\n  It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard\\n  sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American\\n  cities in the Sixties.\\n\\nAwesley replied:\\n    Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to\\n  find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main\\n  guns.\\n\\nI will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67\\nriots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place\\nwithout it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American\\nmilitary firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have\\nbeen *big* news.\\n\\nAwesley goes on:\\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\\n\\nTo fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\\ngrenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\\nperfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since\\nit makes your other claim seem more plausible.\\n\\nAnd on:\\n  I don't\\n  expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and\\nactually\\n  do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know\\n  what you find.\\n\\nI already know what you found: nothing.  If I claimed that the Marines used\\nF-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would you\\nbelieve me?  Would you suspend judgment until you had a chance to research\\nit?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in?\\n\\nIf tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\\nscreaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\\nit.  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \\nIf your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer\\nto live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\\nthose tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"sci.space\",\n          \"sci.med\",\n          \"talk.politics.guns\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
